---name: gsd:research-phasedescription: Research how to implement a phase (standalone - usually use /gsd:plan-phase instead)argument-hint: "[phase]"allowed-tools:  - Read  - Bash  - Task---<objective>Research how to implement a phase. Spawns gsd-phase-researcher agent with phase context.**Note:** This is a standalone research command. For most workflows, use `/gsd:plan-phase` which integrates research automatically.**Use this command when:**- You want to research without planning yet- You want to re-research after planning is complete- You need to investigate before deciding if a phase is feasible**Orchestrator role:** Parse phase, validate against roadmap, check existing research, gather context, spawn researcher agent, present results.**Why subagent:** Research burns context fast (WebSearch, Context7 queries, source verification). Fresh 200k context for investigation. Main context stays lean for user interaction.</objective><context>Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)Normalize phase input in step 1 before any directory lookups.</context><process>## 0.
