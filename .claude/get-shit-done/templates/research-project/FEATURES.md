```</template><guidelines>**Table Stakes:**- These are non-negotiable for launch- Users don't give credit for having them, but penalize for missing them- Example: A community platform without user profiles is broken**Differentiators:**- These are where you compete- Should align with the Core Value from PROJECT.md- Don't try to differentiate on everything**Anti-Features:**- Prevent scope creep by documenting what seems good but isn't- Include the alternative approach- Example: "Real-time everything" often creates complexity without value**Feature Dependencies:**- Critical for roadmap phase ordering- If A requires B, B must be in an earlier phase- Conflicts inform what NOT to combine in same phase**MVP Definition:**- Be ruthless about what's truly minimum- "Nice to have" is not MVP- Launch with less, validate, then expand</guidelines>
