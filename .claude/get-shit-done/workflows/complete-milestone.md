<purpose>Mark a shipped version (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0) as complete. This creates a historical record in MILESTONES.md, performs full PROJECT.md evolution review, reorganizes ROADMAP.md with milestone groupings, and tags the release in git.This is the ritual that separates "development" from "shipped."</purpose><required_reading>**Read these files NOW:**1. templates/milestone.md2. templates/milestone-archive.md3. `.planning/ROADMAP.md`4. `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`5. `.planning/PROJECT.md`</required_reading><archival_behavior>When a milestone completes, this workflow:1. Extracts full milestone details to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-ROADMAP.md`2. Archives requirements to `.planning/milestones/v[X.Y]-REQUIREMENTS.md`3. Updates ROADMAP.md to replace milestone details with one-line summary4. Deletes REQUIREMENTS.md (fresh one created for next milestone)5. Performs full PROJECT.md evolution review6. Offers to create next milestone inline**Context Efficiency:** Archives keep ROADMAP.md constant-size and REQUIREMENTS.md milestone-scoped.**Archive Format:****ROADMAP archive** uses `templates/milestone-archive.md` template with:- Milestone header (status, phases, date)- Full phase details from roadmap- Milestone summary (decisions, issues, technical debt)**REQUIREMENTS archive** contains:- All v1 requirements marked complete with outcomes- Traceability table with final status- Notes on any requirements that changed during milestone</archival_behavior><process><step name="verify_readiness">Check if milestone is truly complete:```bashcat .planning/ROADMAP.mdls .planning/phases/*/SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l```markdown```csv
