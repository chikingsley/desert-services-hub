Creates UAT.md that tracks test progress, survives /clear, and feeds gaps into /gsd:plan-phase --gaps.User tests, Claude records. One test at a time. Plain text responses.</purpose><philosophy>**Show expected, ask if reality matches.**Claude presents what SHOULD happen. User confirms or describes what's different.- "yes" / "y" / "next" / empty → pass- Anything else → logged as issue, severity inferredNo Pass/Fail buttons. No severity questions.
