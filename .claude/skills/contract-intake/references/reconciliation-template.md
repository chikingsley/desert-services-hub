# Contract Reconciliation Template

Quick reference for reconciling contract vs estimate.

## Capture Totals

- **Contract Total:** $________
- **Estimate Total:** $________
- **Variance:** $________
- **Retention %:** ________
- **Billing Platform:** ________
- **Certified Payroll:** Yes / No
- **SOV Present:** Yes / No

## Compare Line Items

1. Mark items for removal (in estimate but NOT in contract)
2. Add new items (in contract but NOT in estimate)
3. Calculate:
   - Items removed: $________
   - Items added: $________
   - Net change: $________

## Validate

```text
(Estimate - Removed + Added) = Contract Total
```

If it doesn't match → STOP → draft clarification questions

## Outcome

- **Match** - Totals align, mark Reconciled
- **Revised Estimate** - Differs but reconciles, save new version
- **Clarification Needed** - Can't reconcile, draft questions

## Red Flags to Check

- Scope items not priced
- "If required" / "as needed" without dollar value
- Ambiguous quantities
- Work outside typical scope
- Certified payroll not disclosed early
- Missing/mismatched SOV
- Unusual retention %
- Contract under IDG (old company name)
