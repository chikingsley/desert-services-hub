## Gaps / Open Questions

1. **Dust permit status** - Not mentioned in Cradle to Crayons request. Clarify if needed.
2. **Start date precision** - "Mid-Feb 2026" is vague. Get specific date for scheduling.
3. **Contract status** - Do we have MSA with Valley Rain? (Not found in search)
4. **Wattle specification** - No quantity given. Need clarification for estimate.

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Create estimate for Cradle to Crayons**
   - Use NW Durango as reference but adjust for simpler scope
   - Include: wattle (TBD qty), 250 LF silt fence, 1 porta john rental
   - Exclude SWPPP (not required per request)

2. **Clarify scope details**
   - Ask Salvador: How much wattle needed?
   - Ask Salvador: Is dust permit required?
   - Confirm "mid-Feb" start date

3. **Send estimate to Salvador**
   - CC Kendra at Valley Rain (she issues POs)
   - Reference the relationship from NW Durango project
