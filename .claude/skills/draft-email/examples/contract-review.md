# Contract Review / Scope Clarification Examples

These are real emails Chi sent when reviewing contracts, LOIs, subcontracts, or purchase orders. The pattern is: state what you reviewed, list specific items with questions, close with what's needed.

---

## Example 1: LOI Review with Scope Questions

**Context**: Reviewing a Letter of Intent for a new project. Multiple line items need clarification.

```
Matt,

I reviewed the LOI and had a few comments/questions (see attached for markup).

Could you provide the schedule of values that you used to get to this $19439 total?

Exhibit A.16 Did you want Desert Services to provide water trucks for Dust Control? Currently, this line would be out of scope but we can provide pricing and include it if you wish.

Exhibit A.16 Dust control compliance is out of scope as we didn't file the permit and are not providing services other than the dust sign. If you need a sticker on the dust sign because of a personnel change, that can be done at

Exhibit A. 16, 19, 22 Lot washes, backflow meter and construction water weren't included in pricing but we can requote with these if you wish.

Exhibit A.30 Unfortunately, we can't do rock entrances in Tuscon at this time.

Exhibit A.34 Silt Fence & Wattle are specified here. Usually only filter sock is required per ADEQ. Did you actually want silt fence? Pricing for that is $5.50/LF vs Compost Filter Sock $2.75/LF

Let me know if you need an updated quote with water trucks for site water/dust control, lot washes, backflow meter.
```

**Pattern**: Reference specific exhibits/sections. State what's in/out of scope clearly. Offer alternatives with pricing.

## Example 2: Contract Entity Name + Insurance Issue

**Context**: Reviewing a contract that has the old company name and insurance coverage mismatch.

```
Hello Victoria,

Almost done reviewing this contract. I just had a couple items I needed clarification/updates on.

Namely:
(1) The contract lists IDG, which is no longer our active company name/entity. Can you update the contract to match Desert Services LLC? I've attached the updated licenses for reference. Let me know if there's anything else need from us to revise the contract.
(2) Then in Exhibits B-2 and B-3, $5M aggregate coverage is required for subs and our current policy has $3M Coverage. Is it possible to amend that to match our $3M umbrella or do you prefer to issue an exception letter?

Should be good to sign after these couple things!
```

**Pattern**: Positive framing ("Almost done"), numbered items for specific issues, ends with forward momentum.

## Example 3: Inspection Count Clarification

**Context**: Reviewing subcontract where inspection quantities don't match ADEQ requirements.

```
Joe,

One clarification/question - the current contract shows 24 inspections for 24 months - but ADEQ requires either:

an inspection at least every 7 days (but not within 5 days of the previous), or

at least every 14 days (but not within 10 days of the previous) plus an inspection within 24 hours after a storm event ≥0.5 inches;

That would push the total to closer to 48 scheduled inspections (would be $18,189.00 total if exactly 48 included) and i'd recommend budgeting ±10% so closer to 52. We can proceed with the current 24 but we'd likely need a change order if the project goes longer than 1 year.

Everything looks good otherwise. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
```

**Pattern**: Cites the regulatory requirement, does the math for them, offers both paths, "Everything looks good otherwise."

## Example 4: Scope Clarification After Call

**Context**: Following up after a phone call to confirm scope changes in writing.

```
Todd,

Following up on this - per our call because the site is under 1 acre, you don't need a narrative, SWPPP Sign or NOI. The only scope left is 1200 LF Sock (See attached).

I confirm we only bill for work completed so if this scope is approved, I can approve the PO for signature on my end to keep the ball rolling. Last step as I mentioned is to forward the site contact/superintendent so we can coordinate the install.
```

**Pattern**: References the call, states what changed, confirms billing approach, lists next step needed from them.
