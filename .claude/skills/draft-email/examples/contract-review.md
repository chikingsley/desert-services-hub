# Contract Review / Scope Clarification Examples

These are real emails Chi sent when reviewing contracts, LOIs, subcontracts, or purchase orders. The pattern is: state what you reviewed, list specific items with questions, close with what's needed.

## Example 1: LOI Review with Scope Questions

**Context**: Reviewing a Letter of Intent for a new project. Multiple line items need clarification.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Reference specific exhibits/sections. State what's in/out of scope clearly. Offer alternatives with pricing.

## Example 2: Contract Entity Name + Insurance Issue

**Context**: Reviewing a contract that has the old company name and insurance coverage mismatch.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Positive framing ("Almost done"), numbered items for specific issues, ends with forward momentum.

## Example 3: Inspection Count Clarification

**Context**: Reviewing subcontract where inspection quantities don't match ADEQ requirements.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Cites the regulatory requirement, does the math for them, offers both paths, "Everything looks good otherwise."

## Example 4: Scope Clarification After Call
