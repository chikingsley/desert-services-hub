# Document Request Examples

Emails requesting specific documents, information, or deliverables needed to proceed with a project.

---

## Example 1: SWPPP Project Kickoff Documents

**Context**: New SWPPP project, need multiple documents and info to get started.

```
Jamie,

If you can, can you provide me with the following:
Confirm the scope/SOV of the contract

For documents, need (1) NOI (2) Civil/Erosion/Construction Plans (3) SWPPP Plan

SWPPP Point of Contact who will be listed on NOI (Usually Superintendent)

Also, to clarify, I do have a SWPPP Plan for FLATS AT BALLPARK VILLAGE - is this a continuation of that project or completely separate?

Dust Permits usually turnaround in 5 business days, I can start the get that started with just construction/civil plans though will need the rest to finish the narrative.
```

**Pattern**: "If you can, can you provide me with the following:" then list items. Adds relevant context (turnaround time, what can start now vs later). Asks clarifying question when there's ambiguity.

## Example 2: Contract Reassignment Request

**Context**: Need a contract or PO redirected to the right person for signature.

```
Brittany,

Can you please reassign this contract to kendra@desertservices.net? She'll get it signed and sent back as soon as she receives it.

Thanks!
```

**Pattern**: Single clear ask, states what will happen next so they know the ball won't be dropped. "Thanks!" as interjection (not closing — still signs off with "Best,").

---

## Example 3: PO Reassignment

**Context**: Same pattern, slightly different wording for a purchase order.

```
Sam,

Can you reassign this PO 3313 to kendra@desertservices.net? We are good to get this signed as soon as she receives.

Thanks!
```

**Pattern**: References the specific PO number, same structure.

---

## Example 4: Scope Clarification with Document Needs

**Context**: Received a PO with redlines, need to clarify scope and get missing info before proceeding.

```
Hi Todd and Kim,

Regarding the estimate, I've updated the scope based on the redlines to the following:

SWPPP Narrative (1 EA) — $1,550.00

Compost Filter Sock (1,200 LF) — $2,940.00

SWPPP Sign (1 EA) — $275.00

Two quick clarifications:
Mobilization/Installation: The "Mobilization" line item wasn't circled like the others. Does that mean you want the filter sock delivered only, or do you need us to install it (which requires the mobilizations)?

If installation needed: add 2× Mobilization @ $255.00 = $510.00

Certified Payroll: The "To Ensure Prompt Payment" doc mentions Certified Payroll "if applicable" — is it required for this specific scope on the VA project?

Let me know so we can match the final numbers.
```

**Pattern**: States what was updated with line-item pricing, then asks specific questions labeled clearly. Gives pricing for the option so they can decide quickly.
