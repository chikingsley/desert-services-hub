# Document Request Examples

Emails requesting specific documents, information, or deliverables needed to proceed with a project.

---

## Example 1: SWPPP Project Kickoff Documents

**Context**: New SWPPP project, need multiple documents and info to get started.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: "If you can, can you provide me with the following:" then list items. Adds relevant context (turnaround time, what can start now vs later). Asks clarifying question when there's ambiguity.

## Example 2: Contract Reassignment Request

**Context**: Need a contract or PO redirected to the right person for signature.

```text
```

**Pattern**: Single clear ask, states what will happen next so they know the ball won't be dropped. "Thanks!" as interjection (not closing — still signs off with "Best,").

---

## Example 3: PO Reassignment

**Context**: Same pattern, slightly different wording for a purchase order.

```text
```

**Pattern**: References the specific PO number, same structure.

---

## Example 4: Scope Clarification with Document Needs

**Context**: Received a PO with redlines, need to clarify scope and get missing info before proceeding.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: States what was updated with line-item pricing, then asks specific questions labeled clearly. Gives pricing for the option so they can decide quickly.
