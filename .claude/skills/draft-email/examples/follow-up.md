# Follow-Up Examples

Short emails checking on status, nudging for action, or requesting updates. These are typically 1-3 sentences.

Frank, Cathie,

Any updates on this counter signature?
```

**Pattern**: Both names, single question, done.

## Example 2: Dust Permit Contact Update

**Context**: Point of contact left the company, need a replacement for the permit.

```
Mike,

Following up on this, I'm reaching out because I was notified Todd Kadjan (kadjant@claycorp.com) is no longer with Clayco. Since, he was the point of contact on this permit, we'll need to update it to stay in compliance.

Who is the new point of contact for STACK Avondale, 2199 Innerbelt Business Center Dr, St Louis, MO 60601, for the dust permit revision?
```

**Pattern**: States the situation factually, explains why it matters (compliance), asks the specific question with enough detail for them to answer.

## Example 3: SWPPP Plan Status

**Context**: Client asked when the plan would be ready.

```
Todd,

Expected by end of next week. Will send it over when it's finished.
```

**Pattern**: Direct answer, no filler.

## Example 4: Contract Modified Total Follow-Up

**Context**: Following up after a call where scope was adjusted.

```
Robert,

Following up from the call, I updated the contract to remove the dust permit since you already filed it. The new total is $15795.00.

Will get the subcontract signed and back to you as we receive the updated.
```

**Pattern**: References the call, states what changed, gives the new number, says what happens next.
