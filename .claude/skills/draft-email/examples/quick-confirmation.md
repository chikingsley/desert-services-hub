# Quick Confirmation Examples

Ultra-short emails — confirmations, handoffs, one-liners. These prove that brevity is the default.

---

## Example 1: Dust Permit Closeout Done

**Context**: Someone asked to close out a dust permit, it's done.

```text
```

**Pattern**: "There you go!" — implies the action is complete and/or attachment is included. Nothing else needed.

---

## Example 2: Timeline Confirmation

**Context**: Someone asked when something would be ready.

```text
```

**Pattern**: Answer + next step. Two sentences.

---

## Example 3: Contract Total Confirmation

**Context**: Confirming a number discussed previously.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Affirms, restates the number, brief explanation.

---

## Example 4: Single Action Request

**Context**: Need someone to do one specific thing.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Shortest possible email — names + one question. No preamble.

---

## When to Use This Pattern

Use quick confirmations when:

- The answer is yes/no or a single fact
- You're delivering something that was already discussed (attachment, link)
- You're nudging on a single outstanding item
- The context is obvious from the email thread

Do NOT pad these with extra sentences. If the email can be one line, make it one line.
