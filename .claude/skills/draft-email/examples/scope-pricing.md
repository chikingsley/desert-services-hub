# Scope & Pricing Examples

Emails about sending quotes, updating pricing, confirming change orders, or clarifying costs.

---

## Example 1: Quote Delivery with Context

**Context**: Sending a quote for temp fence and restroom.

```text
```

**Pattern**: "Here you go!" — casual handoff. States the key pricing constraint upfront. Offers a second contact for questions.

---

## Example 2: Contract Scope Modification with New Total

**Context**: Scope items were added to an existing contract.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Lists each added item with individual pricing, shows the math (modification total + revised total), asks for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Example 3: Confirming Updated Contract Value

**Context**: Simple confirmation that a contract total change is correct.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: Direct confirmation, restates the number, explains what change produces that number. Two sentences.

---

## Example 4: Duplicate Permit Cost Question

**Context**: Discovered a duplicate permit was filed, asking about refund.

```csv
```

**Pattern**: States the situation with specific permit numbers, then "Couple questions:" followed by clear questions. Each question gets its own line/paragraph.
