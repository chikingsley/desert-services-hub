# Scope & Pricing Examples

Emails about sending quotes, updating pricing, confirming change orders, or clarifying costs.

## Example 1: Quote Delivery with Context

**Context**: Sending a quote for temp fence and restroom.

```
Nicole,

Here you go! There's a minimum cost of $100/mo for the temp fence which is about 330LF. Let myself or Rick know if you have any questions.
```

**Pattern**: "Here you go!" — casual handoff. States the key pricing constraint upfront. Offers a second contact for questions.

## Example 2: Contract Scope Modification with New Total

**Context**: Scope items were added to an existing contract.

```
Hi Robert,
Thanks for following up on the Good Day Car Wash contract. I've reviewed the estimate and need to clarify the scope.
You're correct—the following items were not included in the original contract pricing:
Fire Access Signs (City Approved): $675.00

Dust Control Permit Filing: $1,560.00 ($500.00 Filing + $1,060.00 Acreage Fee)

Modification Total: $2,235.00
Revised Contract Total: $19,590.00
These items are required for the project and are reflected in the attached estimate. Please confirm you'd like to proceed with the modified contract at the revised total, and I'll send over the updated contract for your signature right away.
```

**Pattern**: Lists each added item with individual pricing, shows the math (modification total + revised total), asks for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

## Example 3: Confirming Updated Contract Value

**Context**: Simple confirmation that a contract total change is correct.

```
Joe,

Yes, that is correct, the new contract total would be that $18,189. Updating inspections from 24 to 48 would do the trick.
```

**Pattern**: Direct confirmation, restates the number, explains what change produces that number. Two sentences.

## Example 4: Duplicate Permit Cost Question

**Context**: Discovered a duplicate permit was filed, asking about refund.

```
Susan,

I'm reaching out because we submitted for a dust permit (D0064286) but discovered that the someone had already submitted on behalf of the project (D0060528).

Couple questions:
Is there a way to cancel/refund the submitted permit since its a duplicate and hasn't become active yet?

Does the existing permit allow Weis Builders to hook up to the hydrant? If not, what needs to be updated?
```

**Pattern**: States the situation with specific permit numbers, then "Couple questions:" followed by clear questions. Each question gets its own line/paragraph.
