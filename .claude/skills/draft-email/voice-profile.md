# Chi Ejimofor — Email Voice Profile

## Identity

- **Name**: Chi Ejimofor
- **Title**: Project Coordinator
- **Company**: Desert Services LLC
- **Email**: <chi@desertservices.net>
- **Mobile**: (304) 405-2446

## Tone

- Direct. Say what needs to be said, nothing more.
- Professional but not stiff — reads like a competent person talking to another competent person.
- Organized — numbered lists or bullets for multiple items, never buried in a paragraph.
- Confident — states facts and asks clear questions. No hedging ("I was just wondering if maybe...").
- Brief — most emails are 3-8 lines of actual content. If it can be said in 2 sentences, say it in 2 sentences.

## Opening

- First name, comma. That's it. Never "Dear", never "Hi [Name]", never "Hello [Name]" for people you've emailed before.
- For first-time contacts or formal situations, "Hello [Name]," is acceptable but not "Hi".
- Straight into the substance on the next line after a blank line. No pleasantries.

Examples:

- `Matt,`
- `Susan,`
- `Frank, Cathie,` (multiple recipients)
- `Hello Victoria,` (first formal contact)
- `Hi Todd and Kim,` (first contact, less formal)

## Structure

Every email follows this skeleton:

1. **Opening line** — What you did or why you're writing (1 sentence)
2. **Body** — The specifics, using numbered items or bullets if more than one thing
3. **Close** — What you need from them (1 sentence), or nothing if the email is self-contained
4. **Signature**

There is always a blank line between:

- The name and the opening line
- The opening line and the body/bullets
- The body/bullets and the closing line
- The closing line and the signature

## Word Choices — DO Use

- "Let me know if you need..."
- "Quick clarification —"
- "Couple questions:"
- "Following up on this —"
- "If you can, can you provide me with the following:"
- "Everything looks good otherwise."
- "Should be good to [X] after these couple things!"
- "per our call..."
- "Here you go!"
- "There you go!"
- "Can you please..."
- "I confirm we only bill for work completed"
- "to keep the ball rolling"
- "Let myself or [coworker] know if you have any questions."
- "Any updates on..."
- "Will send it over when it's finished."
- "Thanks!" (as an interjection mid-email, NOT as a closing)

## Word Choices — NEVER Use

- "Hope this finds you well"
- "Just wanted to reach out"
- "Per our previous conversation" / "As per our discussion"
- "I wanted to follow up" (use "Following up on this —" instead)
- "Please do not hesitate to" / "Feel free to"
- "At your earliest convenience"
- "Kindly"
- "Best regards," (always just "Best,")
- "Thanks," or "Thank you," as closing (always "Best,")
- "Warm regards,"
- "Sincerely,"
- "Looking forward to hearing from you"
- "Touch base"
- "Circle back"
- "Loop in" (use "I'm adding [name]" or "copying [name]")
- "Apologies for the delay"

## Closing

Always:

```
Best,
--

Chi Ejimofor
Project Coordinator
E: chi@desertservices.net
M: (304) 405-2446
```

The `--` separator is on its own line. There is a blank line between `--` and the name.

## Formatting Rules

- **Bold** for emphasis on key terms, dollar amounts, or project names when they need to stand out — but sparingly.
- **Numbered lists** `(1) (2) (3)` when items are sequential or need to be referenced individually.
- **Bullet points** when listing items that are unordered (documents needed, scope items, etc.).
- **No italics** in emails.
- **No underlining** in emails.
- Line items with pricing: use em dash — between item name and price. Example: `Compost Filter Sock (1,200 LF) — $2,940.00`

## Length Calibration

- **Follow-up/nudge**: 1-2 sentences + signature. Example: "Any updates on this counter signature?"
- **Quick confirmation**: 1-2 sentences. Example: "Yes, that is correct, the new contract total would be that $18,189."
- **Document request**: 3-5 bullet points of what's needed.
- **Contract review**: Opening line + 3-6 numbered items + closing ask. Rarely more than 10 lines of content.
- **Scope/pricing clarification**: Opening context + itemized list + closing question. Usually 5-10 lines.

If you're writing more than 12 lines of body content (excluding signature), it's probably too long. Cut it.
