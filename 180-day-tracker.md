## KEY DECISIONS MADE

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Nov 2025 | Taking dust permits + sign ordering (not handing to Eva) | Automatable processes - better to own and automate than train handoff |
| Nov 2025 | SWPPP narrative binder = automation project, not handoff | Variables come from project initiation - integrate into workflow |
| Nov 2025 | Pilot = own everything from win notification through delivery handoff | Clear ownership boundary, trackable on personal board |

## WHAT I'M TELLING TIM (CEO Meeting Nov 26)

### On Dust Permits + Sign Ordering

> "I'm taking dust permits and sign ordering into my workflow rather than handing off to Eva. This lets me control quality and I'm designing automation that will eventually eliminate the manual work. Eva's capacity is better used elsewhere."

### On My Pilot Process

> "Everything up until delivery is mine. I track on my personal board, follow up, keep context. Once it goes to delivery, I let go. This is a clear ownership boundary that I'm piloting starting next week."
