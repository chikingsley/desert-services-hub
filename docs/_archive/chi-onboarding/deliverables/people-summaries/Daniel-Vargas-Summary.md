## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Daniel Vargas manages the Water Truck and Construction Cleaning divisions with a team of 9 CDL drivers. He operates as the company's "catch-all" director, handling a wide variety of miscellaneous services beyond his primary responsibilities. Working 60+ hours per week (targeting 45), Daniel manages both contracted on-site jobs (60%) and reactive call-in work (40%). He faces significant challenges with labor availability, particularly since SWPPP crews are too busy to provide weekend support as previously arranged, forcing reliance on expensive temporary labor from Labor Systems.

## INTAKE TO EXECUTION PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial Contact

* Receive lead from sales, customer, or manager
* First action: Call customer to establish voice contact
* Schedule site walk or request pictures for estimate

### Step 2: Site Assessment (40% of jobs require site walk)

* *For Cleaning Jobs:**

* Assess dirt level and thickness of silt on asphalt
* Evaluate upkeep during construction (affects time required dramatically)
* Check for physical debris requiring manual removal or skid steer
* Identify water source availability (critical requirement)
* Some contractors (like Sodella) have notoriously dirty sites (13-14 hour jobs)

* *For Dust Control Jobs:**

* Test ground absorption: Pour water and watch seepage rate
* Evaluate soil type and weather conditions (cold = slower absorption = longer wet time)
* Determine frequency of passes needed (every 15-30 minutes depending on conditions)
* All dust control drivers must have 310 dust control certification

### Step 3: Estimation

* Daniel assesses hours, trucks, and labor needed
* Goes to Jared or Dawn for estimate completion (takes 1-2 minutes)
* Internal vs. External decision

  * **Internal:** 1-3 day projects with available capacity
  * **External (Precision Cleaning):** 3+ day projects or when at capacity
  * Precision charges per square foot, company adds 20% markup
  * Daniel remains point of contact even for subcontracted work

### Step 4: Approval & Information Gathering

* 100% require email confirmation (for documentation/protection)
* Information collected

  * PO number (always ask, even if customer doesn't volunteer)
  * Time, dates, location
  * Estimated duration
  * Pictures (85% of customers provide)
  * General contractor name
  * Job site name and address
  * Site contact information
  * Water source confirmation (hydrant/meter/backflow, or water tower)

### Step 5: Scheduling

* *Contract Jobs:**

* Added to Dawn's Excel schedule
* Printed weekly for all drivers
* Each driver receives everyone's full schedule (Monday-Saturday)
* Assign on-site drivers to dedicated projects
* Long-term projects (up to 2 years) keep same driver for relationship building

* *Call-in Jobs:**

* Managed via text message to group chat
* Standard format: GC name, job site name, address, site contact
* Assigned to route drivers (Mick - west side, Chase - central/east, Travis - floater)
* Relies on knowing capacity and schedules mentally

* *Future with BusyBusy App (Currently trialing with Garrett Rich):**

* Clock in at yard → travel time → clock in at site
* Pre-schedule jobs in app for entire week
* Set expected clock in/out times
* Automatic flags for variance
* Will streamline job information entry and work complete tracking

### Step 6: Job Execution

* Drivers receive schedule/text with job details
* First action on site: Contact superintendent
* On-site drivers: 8-hour dedicated shifts at single location
* Route drivers: Multiple locations throughout day
* GPS tracking monitors idle time and movement
* DOT forms completed daily (drivers send pictures of forms)

### Step 7: Work Completion & Billing

* Drivers text/email timesheets and job details to Daniel
* Daniel documents in Notes app on phone (years of records)

  * Job name, times, hits, certifications (e.g., "certified payroll")
  * All work completes maintained chronologically
  * Has requested tablet/laptop for easier management

* Send work completes to Dawn
* Kendra handles billing
* Target: End of day submission
* Reality: 2-5 day lag (sometimes longer due to workload)
* Future: BusyBusy may allow billing to pull data directly

## OPERATIONS & CAPACITY

### Current Capacity Status

* **At capacity** for daily 8-hour contracts
* Can accommodate call-ins by juggling route drivers' downtime windows
* Example: Mick has 10:00-11:30 AM gap between projects for call-in work
* When capacity exceeded: Push jobs out a few days or decline

### Route vs. On-Site Drivers

* *Route Drivers (3):**

* Mick: Takes west side
* Chase: Handles central and east valley
* Travis: Floater

* *On-Site Drivers (6):**

* Dedicated to single job sites (8 hours/day)
* Builds relationships with superintendents
* Projects can last up to 2 years
* Driver stays assigned to learn the site

### Equipment Maintenance & Issues

* *Frequency of Issues:**

* Minor issues requiring attention: Couple times per week (batteries, loose parts, simple fixes)
* Service-impacting breakdowns: 1-2 times per month
* Accidents: Approximately once per year (very rare)

* *Maintenance Process:**

* Drivers complete DOT forms daily (Daniel requires picture proof)
* Most issues should be caught in pre-trip inspections
* Call Noah (fleet mechanic) for on-site repairs
* Towing needed: About once per month (decreasing as fleet improves)
* Second shift mechanics (8 AM start time) handle preventative work
* Fleet improvements ongoing - investing significantly in truck upgrades

* *Non-CDL Trucks:**

* 4 trucks don't meet DOT regulations (old, missing parts like speedometers)
* Used only for long-term on-site projects
* Delivered via flatbed truck and left on-site
* Cost to replace: $60-70K for used 4K trucks

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### 1. Labor Shortage (BIGGEST ISSUE)

* *The SWPPP Agreement Problem:**

* Meeting held couple months ago with Jason, SWPPP crew, Dawn, and Tim
* Agreed SWPPP would provide labor support for cleaning jobs
* **Reality: Zero support provided since meeting**
* SWPPP crews saturated with work, getting overtime through their own jobs
* Previously relied on SWPPP laborers for Saturday lot washing

* *Impact of Labor Systems (Temp Labor):**

* Every lot wash in past 6+ months has used temp labor
* Cost: $45/hour per laborer (vs. ~$24-26 for internal staff)
* "Killing my profit margin" - Daniel's assessment
* Quality/consistency issues with constantly rotating temp workers
* Time investment in training new temps each job
* Complaints can result from inconsistent temp labor quality

* *Proposed Solution:**

* Hire whole new SWPPP crew (4-person crew)
* Designate as shared resource: "You guys are almost floaters"
* Priority for water truck/cleaning when needed
* Otherwise work SWPPP jobs with Jason
* Would reduce SWPPP Saturday overtime, freeing them for cleaning support
* Employees would be hired knowing dual-role expectation

### 2. Work-Life Balance & Hours

* *Current State:**

* 60+ hours per week regular
* Arrives 4-5 AM most days
* Often works until 6 PM or later
* Goal: Reduce to 45 hours/week

* *Factors Contributing to Long Hours:**

* Constant phone calls throughout day ("phone blows up constantly")
* Site walks for estimates
* Manual labor on jobs when short-staffed
* Fill-in work for SWPPP track-out (only 2 certified operators)
* Sunday emergency coverage (worked 14 hours alone on lot wash when crew couldn't finish Saturday)
* Backflow hookups, water connections, miscellaneous requests
* Administrative work (work completes, scheduling, customer communication)

* *Statement:** "I work more hours than anyone in this company"

### 3. Technology & Tools

* *Current Limitations:**

* All work completes managed in phone Notes app (years of records)
* No computer/tablet - uses work phone only
* Must go to Jared/Dawn for estimate entry (can't do it himself)
* Can't check email efficiently in field
* Heavy reliance on manual text messaging for scheduling

* *Improvement Opportunity:**

* Requested tablet or laptop with cellular connection
* BusyBusy app rollout will address many issues
* Could enable self-service estimating
* Better email access in field

### 4. Lack of Job-Level Financial Tracking

* *Current State:**

* No per-project cost vs. revenue tracking
* Tim tracks overall: total hours paid vs. hours billed
* Tracks overall repair costs for division
* Cannot see profitability by individual job

* *Impact:**

* Can't identify which jobs/customers are profitable
* Can't adjust estimating based on actual performance
* Can't demonstrate impact of temp labor costs per job
* Limits ability to make data-driven pricing decisions

* *Opportunity:**

* Dashboard showing estimate vs. actual cost per project
* Would inform future estimating
* Could justify price increases or process changes
* Would help demonstrate temp labor impact

### 5. Pricing Strategy Challenges

* *Current Hesitations:**

* Want to charge more for emergency/same-day service
* Want weekend premium pricing
* But company known for responsive, affordable service
* Fear of losing business by changing pricing model
* Customers accustomed to current prices

* *Price Increase Process:**

* Tim sends out new pricing when costs change
* Recently increased 8-hour rate from $95 to $110/hour
* Daniel communicates new pricing to customers
* 90% acceptance rate
* Company still cheaper than competitors

### 6. Communication & Sales Follow-up

* *Opportunity Identified:**

* Follows up with inspectors to get final inspection lists
* Contacts GCs after finals to offer cleaning/washing
* Only does this when has available time (winter slowdown)
* High conversion - customers often say "you're here now, let's do it"
* Already know company from other services (SWPPP, fencing, porta johns)

* *Potential Improvement:**

* Sales team could systematically follow up on final inspections
* Brandon and Lacey help when Daniel's drivers are low on hours
* Could be more proactive year-round with dedicated resource

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Water Source Requirements

* **Critical requirement:** Water must be available on-site
* Preferred: Hydrant with meter and backflow
* Alternative: Water tower hookup
* Cannot use unauthorized hydrants ($10,000 fine if caught stealing water)
* No water source → Daniel finds neighboring sites to borrow from (negotiates trade)
* Last resort: Provides referrals to other companies
* Occasional exception: Superintendent authorizes use and signs ticket (assumes risk)

### Certified Payroll Jobs

* Must track separately for HR/payroll
* Pay employees higher rate if job requires it (even if above normal wage)
* Always pay at least employee's normal rate (never less)
* Marked clearly in work completes

### Dust Control Specifics

* Requires 310 dust control certification
* Not just spraying - proper technique required
* Weather affects absorption rate (cold = slower = longer wet time)
* Site conditions vary dramatically
* GPS monitoring accounts for legitimate downtime vs. goofing off

### Precision Cleaning (Subcontracting)

* Large pressure washing jobs (3+ days)
* Precision charges per square foot
* Desert Services adds 20% markup
* Daniel remains point of contact
* Handles 1-2 jobs per month
* Previously had dedicated cleaning division with larger labor crew

### Miscellaneous Services

* Fill swimming pools
* Water hookups and connections
* Backflow installations
* Irrigation work
* Track-out installations (rock entrances with gooseneck trailer)
* "We're a full site services company" - if customer asks, they figure it out
* Daniel is the "go-to" for miscellaneous requests

## DANIEL'S PERSPECTIVE & INSIGHTS

### On Labor Challenges

"That's my biggest issue. Temp labors are killing my profit margin... Back in the day I never used temps. We used SWPPP crew for lot wash cleaning labors... Now it seems SWPPP is so flooded with jobs they don't even need to help me to get overtime."

### On Work-Life Balance

"I'm trying to get to 45 hours... I work more hours than anyone in this company... I'm here at four or five in the morning most days and don't leave till [late]."

### On The Dual Role Challenge

"I don't think my director spot really stops with the actual full director side of just being able to sit down and manage... Some full points where I get so caught up doing this job I'll miss a call so then I have to come back to this call."

### On Company Reputation

"That's what Desert Services have been known for though... They call us where they're coming out to get it done for. And that's what we're known for, so it's kind of hard for me to say that we should charge more."

### On Previous Owner

"Mike Lane... gave me the shirt off his back, looked out for me for years... Nothing bad to say about them."

### On The Company's Versatility

"I'm the only one in the company like this... They only do their jobs. [I do] a thousand miscellaneous things... People will just ask us to help with stuff... I like to say we're a full site services company... If you call us up, we'll come down figure it out."

### On Technology Needs

"I've been asking for a tablet or a laptop because how I do my work completes is all off this work phone here... I'm so out and about it's like I don't have to be [in the office] to use it anyway."

### On Customer Relationships

"I got a good rapport with hundreds of superintendents out here from working SWPPP and stuff. They know me, they watched me build up. So like they'll call me and just tell me to get it done."

### Short-term (0-3 months)

1. **BusyBusy rollout:** Complete testing and implement across water truck division
2. **Tablet/laptop provision:** Equip Daniel with mobile device for field management
3. **Work complete backlog:** Address current lag in documentation
4. **SWPPP labor discussion:** Revisit agreement or formalize alternative plan

### Medium-term (3-6 months)

1. **Shared crew hiring:** Recruit and train 4-person SWPPP/cleaning shared crew
2. **Financial tracking:** Implement per-project cost vs. revenue tracking
3. **Pricing strategy:** Test weekend/emergency premiums with select customers
4. **Sales follow-up:** Systematize final inspection follow-up process

### Long-term (6-12 months)

1. **Fleet upgrade:** Continue replacing non-CDL trucks
2. **Cross-training:** Develop redundancy for track-out and specialty services
3. **Dashboard development:** Create management visibility tools for job performance
4. **Work-life balance:** Reduce Daniel's hours to 45/week target through staffing and systems

- --

## CONCLUSION

Daniel Vargas manages a complex, high-demand operation with limited resources and significant manual processes. His division is growing (more on-site contracts than ever) but facing scaling challenges due to labor shortages and administrative burden. The biggest opportunity for improvement is solving the labor problem through a dedicated shared crew, which would eliminate temp labor costs and significantly improve profit margins. Secondary opportunities include technology implementation (BusyBusy, tablet), financial visibility, and sales systematization. Daniel's deep customer relationships, versatility, and work ethic are major assets, but the current model is unsustainable at 60+ hours per week. Strategic investments in staffing and systems could unlock significant value while improving work-life balance.
