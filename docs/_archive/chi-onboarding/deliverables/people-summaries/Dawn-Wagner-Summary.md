## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dawn Wagner manages billing operations for Water Trucks, Street Sweeping, Pressure Washing, and Construction Cleanup divisions using an Excel-based scheduling system on SharePoint. She processes 75-150 emails per day from multiple sources including sales, customers, and answering service. Working closely with directors Daniel Vargas (Water Truck) and Kelly Kline (Street Sweeping), Dawn coordinates work intake, scheduling, and billing across both invoice-based and contract billing workflows. Her system uses color-coding to track job status (yellow = scheduled, blue = contract billing, white = completed) and relies on organizing emails into department-specific folders for efficient retrieval. Key challenges include managing high email volume, waiting 1-2 weeks for timesheets to complete billing cycles, and coordinating with multiple stakeholders across different communication preferences.

## OPERATIONAL DETAILS

### Excel Scheduling System

* *Structure:**

* Maintained on SharePoint for accessibility
* Organized by customer/project
* Includes all scheduled and completed work
* Dawn references it continuously throughout billing cycle

* *Information Tracked:**

* Customer name and project site
* Service date and time
* Service type (Water Truck, Street Sweeping, etc.)
* PO numbers for customers requiring them
* Contact person with phone/email
* Billing notes and special requirements

* *Special Customers Requiring PO Tracking:**

* **Suntec:** Every hit requires separate invoice with specific PO number; "very annoying" per Dawn
* **ELR Colwin:** Must bill with PO 533513
* **Corretti Mix:** Requires PO on invoice
* All Suntec projects need PO tracking

### Billing Process

* *Invoice Billing (Standard Jobs):**

1. Wait for work complete documentation from directors
2. Match work complete against schedule
3. Create invoice in QuickBooks
4. Track PO numbers where required
5. Send invoice to customer

* *Contract Billing (Blue-Highlighted Jobs):**

1. Dawn creates invoice in QuickBooks based on work complete
2. Emails Kendra: "Invoice ready for [Customer/Project]"
3. Kendra receives invite to bill in external platform (Textura, GCPAY, Procore, Premiere)
4. Kendra processes payment through platform

* *Timing Challenges:**

* Must wait until end of month to complete billing
* Actually starts "first or second week of following month"
* Currently 1-2 weeks behind on timesheets
* Example: Week ending October 12th work complete received October 22nd

* *Timesheet Lag Explanation:**

* Timesheets for week ending 19th not submitted until 20th
* Payroll processes and reviews timesheets
* Dawn typically receives them around the 25th
* Results in billing cycle starting early the following month

### Work Complete Documentation

* *From Daniel Vargas (Water Truck/Pressure Washing/Construction Cleanup):**

* Sends email with work complete details
* Includes all jobs, dates, times, and any special notes
* Sometimes includes SWPPP work (Dawn forwards to Jason and Kendra)

* *From Kelly Kline (Street Sweeping):**

* Maintains handwritten work complete sheet
* Takes picture and texts to Dawn
* Dawn texts weekly: "Hey, need work completes for last week"
* Shows all hits including scheduled jobs (Waste Management, Suntec, etc.) and call-ins

* *Matching Process:**

* Dawn cross-references work completes against Excel schedule
* Identifies which jobs were on schedule vs. call-ins
* Uses work complete to track PO requirements
* Determines if job is invoice billing or contract billing

### Email Organization System

* *Folder Structure:**

* **Kelly:** Street Sweeping related emails
* **Daniel:** Water Truck/Pressure Washing/Construction Cleanup
* **Jeff & Jerry:** Estimating
* **Jason:** Inspectors
* **Individual folders:** For other departments/individuals as needed

* *Benefits:**

* Quick searching within specific department
* Don't have to "search whole damn email"
* Just go to folder and search for customer/project name
* Maintains backup documentation for billing disputes

* *Email Management Philosophy:**

* "If you tell me to do something, don't keep asking me. I will do it. Don't send me another fucking email."
* Processes emails as received
* Marks as unread if needs follow-up
* Once completed, moves to folder ("I don't want to touch it again")

### QuickBooks Customer Management

* *Customer Setup:**

* Creates new customers when contracts come in
* Enters all available contact information
* Attaches source documentation (emails, contract details) to customer record
* Uses as "backup for me" and aids in getting paid

* *Project Tracking:**

* One customer can have multiple projects
* Example: One company with 6 different Slim Chickens locations
* Contract must be attached to correct project
* Contract attachments stored in QuickBooks under project

* *Documentation:**

* Attaches confirmation emails to customer record
* Stores all correspondence related to payment issues
* Maintains contract copies under project for reference

## COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES & PATTERNS

### Director Communication Styles

* *Daniel Vargas:**

* Prefers email for documentation
* Also responsive to texts
* Sends typed work completes via email
* "I like email"

* *Kelly Kline:**

* Prefers texting
* Works remotely from home
* Handwritten work completes (pictures via text)
* "Kelly likes texting"
* Dawn has to request weekly: "Need work completes"

* *Dawn's Approach:**

* "As long as I get the communication, I don't care"
* Accepts text, email, or calls
* Priority is receiving the information regardless of channel

### Sales Team Communication

* *Previous Pattern:**

* Sales sent requests directly to directors only
* Dawn missed 15 new sites in September
* "I was dying"

* *Current Pattern (After Dawn's Intervention):**

* Sales includes both director and Dawn on communications
* Text messages to both Daniel/Dawn or Kelly/Dawn
* Emails cc both parties
* Ensures Dawn has intake information for scheduling

### Customer Communication

* *Regular Scheduled Customers:**

* Email schedules to Dawn, Kelly, and sometimes Kendra
* Example: Suntec emails all three with schedule including PO numbers
* Provides advance notice for scheduled hits

* *Call-in Customers:**

* Contact directors directly (80% have direct phone numbers)
* If director misses call, goes to answering service
* Answering service notifies Dawn via email

### Answering Service Integration

* *Purpose:**

* Captures overflow when directors don't answer
* Prevents missed sales opportunities
* Implemented after discovering "thousands of missed calls"

* *Process:**

* Customer call goes to answering service if unanswered
* Service sends email to Dawn with customer details
* Dawn processes like any other work request
* Answering service follows up: "Hey, did you get this? Did you see this? Did you schedule this?"
* Service expects response/confirmation

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### 1. High Email Volume

* *Scale:**

* 75-150 emails per day
* Mix of work requests, confirmations, questions, and follow-ups
* Requires constant attention and processing

* *Management Strategy:**

* Folder organization by department
* Immediate triage and categorization
* Clear communication about not sending duplicate requests

* *Quote:** "If you tell me to do something, don't keep asking me. I will do it. Don't send me another fucking email. I'll probably walk over."

### 2. Timesheet Lag Creating Billing Delays

* *Current Reality:**

* 1-2 weeks behind on receiving timesheets
* Can't start billing until second week of following month
* Example: October 12th work not billed until late October

* *Contributing Factors:**

* Paper timesheets submitted after week ends
* Payroll processing time
* Manual review and approval process

* *Future Improvement (BusyBusy App):**

* Daily time tracking instead of weekly batches
* Could enable real-time billing
* Would reduce lag from 1-2 weeks to 1-2 days potentially
* Dawn hopeful but notes: "I don't know if I'm gonna still be using a spreadsheet either"

### 3. Communication Gaps with Sales

* *Historical Issue:**

* Sales sending requests only to directors
* Dawn missing critical intake information
* 15 new sites added in September without Dawn's knowledge

* *Resolution:**

* Dawn advocated for inclusion ("gave angry eyes," "stomped feet 20 times")
* Now receiving dual communications
* Improved coordination but required assertiveness

* *Ongoing Need:**

* Sales must remember to include Dawn
* Some salespeople more consistent than others
* Requires ongoing reinforcement

### 4. Multiple PO Tracking Requirements

* *Complexity:**

* Different customers have different PO requirements
* Some require PO on every invoice
* Some require separate invoice per PO
* Suntec requires separate invoice for each hit with specific PO

* *Risk:**

* Incorrect PO = payment delays or disputes
* Must track across multiple jobs and dates
* No automated system to flag PO requirements

* *Current Management:**

* Pastes PO numbers into Excel schedule for reference
* Checks schedule when creating invoices
* Relies on memory and detailed notes

### 5. Director Availability & Responsiveness

* *Kelly Kline (Street Sweeping):**

* Works remotely, very limited office presence
* Seen only 3 times in 6 years (once in first 5 years, twice since Tim's ownership)
* Dawn's first impression: "Who's the hell is this homeless person?"
* Requires weekly requests for work completes
* Handwritten documentation requires picture texting

* *Impact:**

* Less immediate feedback on schedule questions
* Weekly batch work complete submissions instead of daily
* Harder to clarify discrepancies or missing information

### 6. Contract Coordination Complexity

* *Contract Intake Process:**

* Jared sends contracts to entire office
* Each person must "pick through" to find relevant scope
* Not always clear who needs to be involved

* *Example Issue (Findor vs. Red Point):**

* Contract showed Red Point but work under Findor
* Mike Hammond requested pre-qual under Findor
* Dawn had to clarify: "Is it under Red Point or under this?"
* Required morning of coordination to correct customer setup

* *Communication Needs:**

* Sales should inform directors directly about contract start-ups
* Example: "We're going on schedule for water truck on this contract like GCON"
* Dawn sometimes learns about changes indirectly or late
* Discovered WD contract reduced from 8 hours/day when "ran out of money" - wasn't informed promptly

### 7. Schedule Changes & Cancellations

* *Customer Patterns:**

* Frequent rescheduling (particularly Suntec: "very annoying")
* Last-minute cancellations
* Schedule changes without formal notice

* *Dawn's Approach:**

* Leaves items in schedule even if not completed
* Asks directors "What's happening? Why didn't we hit this hit?"
* Sometimes customers reschedule repeatedly

* *System Limitation:**

* No automated change tracking
* Relies on director communication
* Manual follow-up required

### 8. "Old School" System Concerns

* *Self-Awareness:**

* Dawn acknowledges she's "the old school one"
* Other billing coordinators (Porta John, Rolloff) use Crow for scheduling and completing
* Uncertainty about future: "I don't know if I'm gonna still be using a spreadsheet either"

* *Works But Not Ideal:**

* System functions: "It works, you know"
* Requires significant manual effort
* Not scalable with business growth
* No integration with other systems

## DAWN'S PERSPECTIVE & INSIGHTS

"I don't know if I'm gonna still be using a spreadsheet either. You know?"

### On Contract Confusion

[Regarding Findor/Red Point issue]
"I looked at here I was like well that don't really match Red Point... So then the guy replies like, you know... it's under Findor. So this has all happened this morning."

### On Work Complete Matching

"Anything in yellow, it means it's scheduled. And if it's not hit, I ask Kelly. Kelly Kelly, what's happening? Why didn't we hit this hit?"

## CONCLUSION

Dawn Wagner manages complex billing operations for four service families using manual Excel-based systems while processing 75-150 emails daily from diverse sources. Her organizational skills, folder-based email system, and color-coded scheduling approach enable her to coordinate between directors, sales, customers, and contract billing platforms. However, the system faces scalability challenges as the business grows. The primary opportunities for improvement center on implementing digital timekeeping (BusyBusy), transitioning from Excel to an integrated scheduling and billing platform, standardizing contract communication, and automating PO requirement tracking. The current 1-2 week billing lag could be reduced to 1-2 days with real-time work complete data, significantly improving cash flow. Dawn's deep knowledge of customer requirements, billing workflows, and organizational systems makes her a critical resource, but the manual nature of her current processes creates bottlenecks and limits scalability. Strategic investments in technology and process standardization would unlock significant efficiency gains while maintaining the accuracy and customer service quality Dawn currently delivers.
