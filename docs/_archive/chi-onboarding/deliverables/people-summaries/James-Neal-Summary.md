## Key Processes Documented

### Process 1: Printing Inspection Forms

* *Reference:** This process is fully documented in [SOPs/printing_inspections_sop.md](/Users/chiejimofor/Documents/ds-process-workflow/SOPs/printing_inspections_sop.md)

* *High-Level Overview:**

1. Access master schedule on SharePoint
2. Sort by inspector and last inspection date
3. Update "Last Inspection" dates (never touch "Next Inspection" - contains formula)
4. Download working copy to desktop
5. Use Word mail merge with Master Inspection Report Print template
6. Print specified range with single-sided, hole-punched settings

* *Pain Points:**

* Multi-step manual process
* Requires dual monitors for efficiency (difficult to do from home on laptop)
* Risk of accidentally modifying master file

### Process 2: Post-Final Inspection Upselling (INNOVATION)

* *Overview:** James developed this revenue-generating process approximately one month before the interview. This represents a proactive approach to capturing additional business at project closeout.

* *Detailed Process Flow:**

* *Step 1: Pre-Call Preparation**

* Before conducting final inspection, call Kendra (billing/accounting)
* Kendra checks if client has remaining budget in their contract
* Example: One client had $6,000 remaining in their SWPPP contract

* *Step 2: On-Site Assessment**

* Conduct final inspection as normal
* Assess site cleaning needs
* Note that GCs typically remain on-site for ~1 month after final inspection

* *Step 3: Client Engagement**

* Call superintendent/project manager
* Mention that final inspection is complete
* Ask if they need site cleaning or street sweeping services
* Do NOT disclose exact amount of remaining budget
* Position it as: "I know you normally have work to do after finals, and I see you still have budget in your contract"

* *Step 4: Email Documentation**

* Send final inspection report to GC
* Include language: "Place in section E of your SWIP book"
* Add: "If there's anything else that you need, we also offer site cleaning. We also offer street sweeping."
* CC the following people

  * Don (billing)
  * Kendra (billing/contracts)
  * Daniel (site cleaning operations)
  * Kelly (site cleaning operations)

* *Step 5: Follow-Through**

* If GC expresses interest, get email confirmation
* Connect with Daniel/Kelly to schedule cleaning
* Ensure all parties are coordinated

* *Results to Date:**

* Successfully converted 2-3 jobs within first month
* Common client reaction: "Oh shit, you guys do this?"
* Demonstrates strong cross-selling opportunity at critical touchpoint

* *Adoption Status:**

* James shared this approach at last month's SWIP team meeting
* Tim (management) was "really stoked on it"
* Other inspectors may be implementing, but James is not tracking their adoption
* James's philosophy: "I'm not my brother's keeper" - do his best and share with others

## Database & File Management

### Master Schedule (SharePoint)

* *Location:** SharePoint → Location Upload Main Master

* *Structure:**

* Contains all inspections for all inspectors (Herbie, Logan, James, etc.)
* Can be sorted by: Inspector, Company Name, Job Detail, Last Inspection, etc.
* Critical columns

  * **Last Inspection:** Updated manually by inspectors
  * **Next Inspection:** Contains formula - NEVER MODIFY
  * **Inspector Name**
  * **Company Name**
  * **Project Details**
  * **Contact Information**

* *Best Practice:**

* Always work from a downloaded copy, never directly in master file
* Reason: "If there was an issue in it, the old system talking the new system" could cause problems
* Risk of accidentally corrupting data if working directly in master

### Project Lifecycle Management

* *Adding New Projects:**

1. Monitor daily schedule email for "Swift Inspections" entries without inspector assigned
2. Copy an existing row from the same company (MT jobs, etc.)
3. Paste to bottom of uploads sheet
4. Update all information while preserving inspector contact details
5. Sorting by company name makes this easier (alphabetical order)

* *Closing Out Projects:**

1. Conduct final inspection
2. Send final inspection report with upsell language (see Process 2)
3. Highlight project row and copy
4. Navigate to "Completed" tab at bottom of spreadsheet
5. Paste into completed projects
6. Delete from main upload sheet

* *Completed Projects Tracking:**

* Over 1,000 projects completed to date
* Permanent record maintained on separate tab
* James has personally completed many of these

- --

## Scanning & Filing Process

### Daily Scanning Workflow

* *Physical Process:**

1. Complete handwritten inspection reports in field (3 sheets per inspection)
2. Return to office daily
3. Scan each complete report (all 3 pages together)
4. Reports save to local scan folder
5. Rename file with format: [Company] [Project] [Date]

    * Example: "Mezzo Desert Ridge 10-2025"

* *Digital Filing:**

1. Pull scanned PDF from scan folder to desktop
2. Open SharePoint
3. Navigate to Projects folder
4. Locate specific company folder (organized A-M, N-Z)

    * Example: CSI Construction → Projects A-M → CSI → Mezzo
5. Drag and drop PDF from desktop to SharePoint folder

* *Email Distribution:**

1. Open master schedule to access contact information
2. Copy superintendent/PM email address
3. Create new email
4. Attach renamed PDF
5. Send to GC (with upsell language if final inspection)
6. Delete desktop copy after upload complete

* *Time Investment:**

* Light week (5-6 inspections/day): Minimal time
* Heavy week (10-12 inspections/day): More significant
* Integrated into daily routine at office

* *Pain Points:**

* Billing dependencies: Kendra/Don will email if inspection missing from billing folder

  * Example: "PCDS doesn't have a 10/15 inspection in there"
  * Caused by accidentally deleting from desktop before uploading to SharePoint

* Need for dual monitors: "If I'm half screen on my email and half screen over here, this file itself is huge"
* Home scanning challenges: "When I'm at home I got three kids clawed on me" - difficult to be efficient

## Customer Service & Communication

### Contact Patterns

* *Who Calls James:**

* Superintendents (primary contact)
* Project Managers (PM) - often assistants to superintendents
* Superintendents call for technical questions, site-specific issues
* PMs call when superintendent is too busy

* *When They Call:**

* When they need corrective actions completed
* Technical SWPPP questions
* Emergency/urgent situations ("I need it yesterday")
* Schedule coordination

* *Who Calls Jason:**

* Long-term relationships (20+ years in AZ construction)
* Operational/scheduling matters
* High-level GC relationships
* Jason "is on the phone all the fucking time"

### Response Philosophy

* *James's Approach:**

> "I'm very diligent about responding to people right away. I feel like some of the inspectors aren't. In the customer service side, being reactive - they're calling me because they need help. Nine times out of ten when they need something from us they need it yesterday."

* *Response Timing:**

* Same-day response to all calls/emails
* Often responds while driving (adds 30-45 min to timesheet for evening work)
* Reviews daily schedule email every evening from home
* Checks for any urgent issues or new projects

### Relationship Building

* *Site Walks:**

* Conducts walks with contractors like Tim (20+ years in AZ construction)
* Explains SWPPP requirements
* Builds trust through technical expertise
* Creates better paper trail for DEQ review

* *Knowledge Sharing:**

> "I like to know what's going on. I like to know where new projects are starting, even if it's not my area. Sometimes it's like 'oh I know that superintendent.' I just like to be knowledgeable. If I know what's going on in the company, it's a better look for me as an authoritative [figure]."

* *Daily Schedule Review:**

* Reviews entire company schedule daily, not just his projects
* Notes new projects, even in other inspectors' territories
* Stays informed about company-wide operations
* Recognizes superintendents across different projects

- --

## Inspection Reporting & Enforcement

### Report Writing

* *Deficiency Documentation:**

> "Literally. I mark your site deficient. All corrective actions need to be completed within seven days from this date and the section noted in the corrective action law."

* *Professional Standards:**

* Signs name on every report
* Personal liability: "If the powers that be were relying on this, I could lose my certifications"
* Takes compliance documentation seriously
* Creates paper trail for Department of Environmental Quality

* *Follow-Up Approach:**

* Cannot directly sell corrective services ("fox and the hen house")
* Documents what needs to be fixed professionally
* GC must request services via email (required for billing)
* 75% of the time: "I say hey you need this fixed" and they handle it

### Ethical Boundaries

* *What James CANNOT Do:**

> "I can't walk around and kick over your silt fence and be like 'oh you need some silt fence' and charge you. It's up to them. I'm informing them and letting them know, hey, this is what I see as a professional. This is what I see that you need. But it's up for them to pick up the phone or email."

* *Required Documentation:**

* All service requests must be in email form
* Verbal agreements not sufficient
* Protects company from non-payment disputes
* Don frequently "fighting with people to get paid"

### Digital Format Transition

* *Future State:**

* Compliance Go system can schedule recurring inspections
* Automatically uploads dates, numbers, all data needed
* Sets 14-day or 7-day recurring schedules
* Will send deficiency reports to Jason automatically
* Jason can then proactively contact GCs about needed services
* May reduce paper-based workflow significantly

## Cross-Department Collaboration

### Billing Department (Don, Kendra)

* *Kendra's Role:**

* Manages contract budgets
* Tracks remaining funds in client contracts
* Key partner in upselling process
* Provides budget information for final inspection upselling

* *Don's Role:**

* Handles accounts receivable
* Follows up on unpaid invoices
* Needs scanned reports for billing
* Alerts inspectors to missing documentation

* *Communication Pattern:**

* James emails scanned reports to Don and Kendra
* They use reports for billing clients
* They alert James if reports are missing
* Kendra proactively helps identify upsell opportunities

### Site Cleaning Team (Daniel, Kelly)

* *Collaboration:**

* James CCs them on final inspection emails
* They receive upsell opportunities directly
* Can coordinate scheduling with GCs
* Daniel is "crazy busy" managing cleaning operations

* *James's Innovation:**

* Previously, Daniel would learn about finals after the fact and try to follow up
* Now, Daniel is CC'd immediately when final inspection is sent
* Gives Daniel earlier touchpoint to engage GC
* Up to Daniel/sales to follow through on opportunities

### Operations/Scheduling (Jason)

* *Jason's Responsibilities:**

* Creates daily SWIP schedule email
* Manages operations
* Fields GC calls for scheduling
* On phone constantly with customers

* *James's Support:**

* Reviews Jason's daily schedule
* Identifies new projects requiring inspections
* Self-manages adding projects to master schedule
* Calls Jason when GCs have urgent needs on-site

* *Communication Flow:**

* GC calls James about urgent need (e.g., "I need 600 feet of sock on this side, man")
* James calls Jason second
* Jason coordinates with installation crews
* Ensures rapid response to customer needs

### Sales Team

* *Touch Points:**

* Sales visit sites more frequently than inspectors (James visits every 2 weeks to 1 month)
* Sales can spot issues between James's visits
* Sales receive requests from GCs and coordinate services
* Sales act as "secondary layer to customer service"

* *Challenge - Too Many Cooks:**

> "It's almost too many people involved. I like to know obviously what's going on on my site."

* *Email Discovery:**

* James sometimes sees his sites pop up on schedule with service requests he didn't know about
* Example: "They need to relocate their fence 600 feet, they need 300 feet of compost sock and I'm like I didn't know that"

* *Silver Lining:**

* James can check those items on next visit
* Shows GC that company is "on it" rather than just "$200 report, see you later bye"
* Creates better impression with GC
* Builds better paper trail for DEQ review

### Sales Strategy - One-Stop-Shop

* *Company Push:**

* Sales encouraged to get entire jobs: SWIP, roll-offs, porta-potties, etc.
* Pitch: "Why are you gonna call eight different people to get your shit?"
* One company, one contact for multiple services

* *Sales as Facilitator:**

* Sales build relationships with GCs/superintendents
* GC calls sales for any need
* Sales coordinates: "I need a sweeper at this site, I need porta-potties, I need fence moved"
* Centralized request handling

* *Website Service Requests:**

* desertservices.net has quick request form
* Get 1-2 requests per day from website
* Some are existing clients, some are new prospects
* Request goes to appropriate division automatically

## Inspection Schedule & Frequency

### Standard Cycles

* *14-Day Inspections:**

* Most common inspection frequency
* Required by typical SWPPP regulations
* James manages scheduling through master database
* Rain events can push schedules back

* *Monthly Inspections:**

* Some sites only require monthly visits
* Lower-risk sites or different permit requirements

* *7-Day Inspections:**

* Less common
* Higher-risk sites or specific regulatory requirements

### Volume Metrics

* *Weekly Inspection Volume:**

* Light week: 5-6 inspections per day
* Heavy week: 10-12 inspections per day
* Averages vary with weather, project schedules

* *Rain Impact:**

> "1013 it was raining two inches and I have hit every single one of my [sites]"

* *Recent Example:**

* One print run: 82 inspections × 3 sheets = 246 pages
* Represents approximately 2 weeks of backlogged inspections

### Geographic Coverage

* *Primary Territory:**

* East side of Phoenix metro area
* Most sites clustered in assigned region
* Can cover entire day's route without excessive driving

* *Example Sites Mentioned:**

* Busy Bees Daycare - Levine
* Mezzo Desert Ridge
* PCDS
* Homestead at Lehigh Crossing (MT job)
* Multiple CSI Construction projects

### Weather Disruptions

* *Rain Event Impacts:**

* Forces rescheduling of installations
* Increases inspection volume (rain-related deficiencies)
* Customer calls spike: "200 customers calling us because we need to go out and fix fence"
* Can push installs by 5+ days (10/15 becomes 10/20)
* More rain this season has given James more practice with printing process

* *Customer Expectations:**

> "Every customer needs to feel like they're number one."

## Challenges & Pain Points

### Process Inefficiencies

* *Printing Process:**

* Multi-step manual process with many potential failure points
* Risk of corrupting master file
* Requires physical presence in office
* "It's a lot of steps" - James's assessment
* Old technology (mail merge wizard) but it works
* Probably more modern ways to accomplish this

* *Scanning Workflow:**

* Daily manual scanning of individual reports
* Easy to accidentally delete before uploading to SharePoint
* Causes billing issues when reports go missing
* Time-consuming on heavy inspection weeks

* *Home Office Limitations:**

* Laptop-only setup inefficient
* Large files difficult to navigate on single screen
* Family distractions ("three kids clawed on me")
* Results in coming to office daily anyway

### Operational Challenges

* *Response Time Pressure:**

* "I don't wanna go to a site and write them up for deficiencies and have them email a request that day and [we take] two weeks"
* Documentation of slow response is liability
* Could impact inspector certifications
* Customer service expectations vs. crew availability

* *Capacity Constraints:**

* Don't want crews "sitting around the yard" (overstaffed)
* But also can't leave customers waiting weeks
* Seasonal fluctuations (December/January slow period)
* Difficult to balance staffing levels
* Heavy use of general labor for water truck and cleaning

* *Information Silos:**

* Sales making commitments James doesn't know about
* "It's almost too many people involved"
* Discovers service requests through schedule review rather than direct communication
* Prefers direct calls from GCs to maintain context

* *Documentation Requirements:**

* Everything must be in email for billing protection
* Phone calls not sufficient
* Verbal agreements lead to non-payment disputes
* Construction industry: "I need an email"

### Knowledge Management

* *No Formal Notification System:**

> "Nobody tells us when we're getting a new project and when we have to start inspections."

* *Self-Service Approach:**

* Inspectors must review daily schedule themselves
* Look for "Swift Inspections" entries without inspector names
* Must proactively add to master schedule
* Risk of projects falling through cracks

* *Template/Formula Mystery:**

* "I don't know if the top or bottom one [in Select Table] matters"
* Some process steps unclear even to experienced users
* Learned through repetition and trial/error
* Rain events provided more practice opportunities
