## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Jayson Roti manages SWPPP operations including project intake, SWPPP book creation, installation scheduling, crew coordination, and customer communication. He serves as the central hub connecting estimators, billing, inspectors, field crews, and customers. Working across multiple platforms (QuickBooks, SharePoint, Excel task lists, Crow), Jayson handles everything from NOI coordination and dust permit processing to emergency installations and rework requests. His role requires constant multitasking—fielding customer calls, creating SWPPP narratives with Eva, scheduling installations, coordinating with inspectors, and managing work completes. The position involves significant manual data entry, redundant information capture across systems, and coordination bottlenecks caused by incomplete handoffs from estimating and sales.

## WORK INTAKE & FLOW

### Sources of Work

* *1. New Contract Installations (Jared/Estimating)**

- Contract awarded, sent to Jayson
- Must verify contract matches estimate (dollar amounts, line items)
- Gather NOI, dust permit, site contact, schedule
- Common issue: Contracts don't match estimates, require clarification

* *2. Direct Customer Calls**

- Superintendents call directly for installations or rework
- Must obtain email approval before proceeding
- "I need an email" - standard response to verbal requests
- Entered into QuickBooks with approval attached

* *3. Inspector-Identified Deficiencies**

- Inspectors write up deficiencies (fence down, sock damaged, rock entrance deteriorated)
- Superintendent calls to request repair
- Inspector should provide: quantity needed, location, photos
- Reality: Often missing details, requiring Jayson to call back

* *4. Sales/Site Services**

- Rick, Brandon, Lacey identify needs during site visits
- Sometimes Jayson discovers work scheduled he didn't know about
- "Too many cooks" - multiple people coordinating same sites

* *5. Emergency/Weather Events**

- Wind damage, rain washouts
- "200 customers calling because we need to fix fence"
- Can push scheduled installs by 5+ days
- Crews at capacity with emergency response

### Work Types

* *SWPPP Narrative & Book Creation:**

- Customer pulls NOI (Notice of Intent) from ADEQ
- Jayson requests NOI, dust permit, site information
- Eva creates narrative from template using provided information
- Jayson reviews: dates, addresses, contractor names, soils maps, section breaks
- Common corrections: Section pagination, 2020→2025 permit dates, removing irrelevant BMPs
- Books assembled with: Narrative, NOI, dust permit, soils report, endangered species report, boilerplate BMPs
- MT Builders requires fully digitized/scanned books (protective measure - harder to copy)
- Most customers receive physical books only

* *Compost Filter Sock Installation:**

- Perimeter BMP (Best Management Practice)
- Must confirm: temp fence already installed (or install temp fence first)
- Sock gets damaged if fence installers walk/drive over it
- Most critical initial BMP for site compliance

* *Temp Fence Installation:**

- On posts (pounded) vs. on stands (sandbags - extra cost)
- Privacy screening optional (half vs. full height)
- Should be installed BEFORE sock to protect BMPs
- Can be us or another contractor

* *Rock Entrance Installation:**

- Requires site prep by dirt contractor
- Must confirm entrance area is ready (graded, cleared)
- Coordinated with Daniel/Dalton (tractor required)
- Rock ordered morning of installation from delivery service
- Pay per hour for dump truck delivery
- Attempt to complete same day as order

* *Inlet Protection:**

- Storm drain inlets vs. curb inlets
- Must verify: Are inlets already installed? (new site = not yet)
- If not ready, mark "at a later date" and schedule when called
- Protect with fabric/filters per SWPPP requirements

* *SWPPP Signs & Stickers:**

- Required on all job sites
- Recent: New general construction permit (2025) requires updated stickers
- All old sites need new ADEQ sticker with updated permit number
- Customer pays for sticker replacement (~$75)
- Must obtain email approval before ordering
- Karen orders from vendor, Herbie installs

* *Water Meter Setup:**

- Coordinated by Daniel (not Jayson's direct responsibility)
- Backflow certification required before use
- Must be certified before old meter removed
- Sometimes inspector identifies water meter issues

### Precommunication & Coordination

* *Before Installation Day:**

- Jayson creates installation schedule (printed sheets for each crew)
- Includes: Company, site name, address, site contact, work scope, quantities
- Crew leads supposed to call ahead to confirm site ready
- Reality: "They never check their fucking email"
- Jayson sends weekend schedules via email, crews don't always see them

* *Day of Installation:**

- Crews call site contact to confirm readiness
- Common issues discovered

  - "We're not ready" (site not prepped)
  - "We went home" (Friday afternoon pushbacks)
  - Inlets not yet installed
  - Dirt contractor hasn't cleared perimeter

- If crew can't reach site contact, they call Jayson
- Jayson attempts contact, reschedules if needed

* *Site Readiness Questions:**

- Are inlets installed? (If no: schedule for later date)
- Is temp fence up? (Affects sock installation order)
- Is rock entrance area prepped? (Requires dirt contractor work)
- Is site contact available? (Required for coordination)
- Any special site requirements? (PPE, parking restrictions, access hours, badging)

## PROJECT LIFECYCLE: INTAKE TO DELIVERY

### Step 1: Contract Receipt

* *From Jared (Estimating):**

- Contract sent via email to general distribution
- Includes: Customer name, project name, dollar amount, line items
- May or may not match original estimate

* *Jayson's First Actions:**

1. Locate estimate in QuickBooks
2. Compare contract to estimate line-by-line
3. Identify discrepancies (dollar amounts, missing items, added items)
4. Example issues found:

    - Fire sign requested but not on estimate
    - SWPPP sign on estimate but not on contract
    - Different quantities than estimated
    - Schedule of values doesn't match

* *Common Problems:**

- "This should have all been done before it got to me"
- Estimate may be in Monday.com, not QuickBooks (Jared's new system)
- Other staff can't see estimates in Monday.com
- Results in 20+ emails back and forth with multiple people
- Jayson, Kendra, Jared, customer all on thread trying to reconcile

### Step 2: Information Gathering

* *Required Information (varies by contract):**

* *For SWPPP Narrative/Book:**

- NOI (Notice of Intent) with ADEQ number
- Dust permit (or confirmation customer will pull their own)
- Site address and legal description
- Project acreage
- Contractor name (whoever is on NOI must match book)
- Site contact name and phone
- General contractor company name

* *For All Installations:**

- Site address
- Site contact (superintendent/PM)
- Email approval to proceed
- When ready for installation
- Any special site requirements

* *Site-Specific Requirements (example: Guthrie site):**

- Site access hours
- Trade parking restrictions
- PPE requirements
- Pre-task plans
- Badging requirements (Don handles)
- No eating/drinking on site
- OSHA vs. other safety requirements
- "All this stuff needs to be in one packet before it gets to me"

* *Current Process:**

- Jayson must request this information via email
- Often multiple follow-up requests
- Information comes in piecemeal
- No standardized handoff from estimating/sales
- Jared should be gathering during estimate phase but doesn't always

* *Ideal State:**

- "When contract is done, I should get a packet with all of this"
- Eliminate back-and-forth information requests
- Reduce email volume and coordination time

### Step 3: QuickBooks Setup

* *Creating/Updating Customer Entry:**

- Search for customer (may be under different name)
- Create new customer if doesn't exist
- Example: Searched "Reliance," found under "99 Holdings"

* *Attaching Approvals:**

- All email approvals attached to customer record
- Required for audit protection
- Allows proving customer requested work
- Don (billing) needs this for collections

* *Job Creation:**

- Create job under customer name
- Match job name to contract (critical for billing)
- Sometimes Kendra or Jared should do this, but Jayson often does it
- "He should be putting it in here when he's doing estimate"
- Saves Jayson and Kendra time if done upfront

* *Common Issue:**

- Duplicate entry of information
- Estimate data in one place, Jayson retyping into QuickBooks
- "It's stupid to have to retype this when it's somewhere else"
- No clear way to import/transfer information

### Step 4: SWPPP Book Creation

* *Jayson's Process:**

* *A. Gather Materials:**

- NOI from customer (PDF)
- Dust permit (if applicable)
- SWPPP plan (from Jared - should be in SharePoint "SWPPP Plans" folder)
- Common problem: Plan in Monday.com instead, can't find it

* *B. File Organization:**

- Creates folder with all project documents
- Prints two copies of NOI for physical files
- Stores digital copies in SharePoint project folder
- Maintains personal working folder with "guts" of each active project

* *C. Task Tracking:**

- Maintains Excel task list of all books in progress
- Columns: Company, Project, Status, Date received, Notes
- Color coding

  - Pink: Waiting for information (NOI, plan, etc.)
  - Yellow: In progress
  - Green: Narrative complete, ready for delivery
  - Completed: Moved to "Complete NOIs to be made" folder

- Updates status as project progresses
- Example entry: "10/24 received NOI ADEQ# [number] - change from waiting for NOI to in progress"

* *D. Hand to Eva:**

- Provides Eva with: NOI, dust permit (if available), any plans
- Places in physical binder for Eva to work from
- Eva creates narrative using templates

* *E. Review Eva's Work:**

- Reviews entire narrative page by page
- Checks

  - Date correct (10/10/2025, not 8/20)
  - Address matches NOI
  - Contractor name matches NOI exactly
  - Acreage matches (lat/long coordinates)
  - Site contact name and title
  - Soils map matches location (verify visual correlation)
  - Section breaks on new pages (sections 3, 4, 5 each start new page)
  - 2020 permits changed to 2025
  - Unnecessary BMPs removed (e.g., silt fence if not used)
  - Inspector names up to date (add James, update list)
  - All appendices included: NOI, dust permit, endangered species, game/fish, BMPs

* *Common Corrections:**

- Section 1.1 needs page break pushed down
- Remove "silt fence" from template if not applicable
- Update 2020→2025 permit dates
- Verify correct soils map pulled

* *F. Final Assembly:**

- Eva pulls sections from templates
- Most of book is "boilerplate" (Appendix M - BMPs, etc.)
- Front section customized per project
- Physical book assembled in binder with tabs
- Some customers (MT Builders) require full digitized scan

* *G. Update Tracking:**

- Mark in Excel as complete (green)
- Move to "completed" folder once delivered
- Update task list with completion date

* *Time Investment:**

- Jayson previously did 20 narratives on weekends
- Each takes 1.5-2 hours when doing himself
- Now Eva does creation, Jayson reviews
- Still time-consuming when hunting for missing information

### Step 5: Installation Scheduling

* *Receiving Installation Requests:**

* *Contract-Based (Planned):**

- New project with installations in contract
- Schedule based on customer's project timeline
- Coordinate with site readiness

* *Call-In (Reactive):**

- Superintendent calls: "I need sock installed"
- Must get email approval
- Try to schedule within days
- Sometimes same-day if crew availability

* *Deficiency-Based (Rework):**

- Inspector writes up deficiency
- Super calls to request repair
- Need to know: How much? Where? (should get from inspector)
- Reality: Inspector often doesn't provide details

* *Information Needed Before Scheduling:**

- Is site ready for each BMP?

  - Temp fence: Amount, pounded vs. stands, privacy screening?
  - Sock: Is temp fence already up?
  - Rock entrance: Is entrance area prepped? How much rock?
  - Inlets: Are they installed yet?

- Site contact and phone number
- Address and directions
- Any access restrictions or special requirements
- Timeline/urgency

* *Coordinating Rock Entrances:**

- Requires Daniel or Dalton (tractor operators)
- Must call rock supplier morning-of
- Pay hourly for dump truck delivery
- Try to complete same day
- Separate scheduling from main crews

* *Creating Schedule Sheets:**

- Jayson creates printed work orders for each job
- Includes

  - Company name
  - Site name and address
  - Site contact and phone
  - Work scope (install 1200' sock, 16' fence, etc.)
  - Specific instructions (on posts, on stands, etc.)
  - Any special notes

- Printed and ready by end of day (often working until 6:30 PM)
- Crews pick up sheets in morning

* *Prioritization:**

- First job listed = first priority (must be done morning)
- Example: "Clayco - MUST BE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING"
- Other jobs filled in throughout day
- Geography considered for route efficiency
- Urgent jobs highlighted

* *Common Scheduling Issues:**

- Two jobs canceled day-of (Friday afternoon, supers went home)
- Pushes work to Monday when schedule already full
- "Fucks up the next day's schedule"
- Try calling other sites to fill gaps, often unsuccessful
- Crews starting 3 AM, willing to work but sites not ready

* *Weekend Work:**

- Jayson sends schedules via email over weekend
- Crews "never check their fucking email"
- Monday morning: "I didn't see the email"
- Jayson: "You're supposed to look at your email every day"

### Step 6: Day-of Coordination

* *Crew Responsibilities:**

- Call site contact before arrival
- Confirm site is ready
- Verify work scope
- If can't reach contact, call Jayson

* *When Sites Aren't Ready:**

- Crew calls Jayson
- Jayson attempts to reach site contact
- If unsuccessful or pushed, reschedule
- Update schedule, notify crew of next job
- Sometimes call multiple sites to fill gap

* *Tracking Work in Progress:**

- Crews supposed to text Jayson when job complete
- "Where are you going next?"
- Without app tracking, relies on crew communication
- Not always reliable
- Considering BusyBusy app (like other divisions)

* *Crow App Discussion:**

- Could work for SWPPP dispatch
- Issue: Complex work scope entry
- Each job has multiple variables (feet of sock, type of fence, screens added, etc.)
- Needs "McDonald's app" simplicity - checkboxes for options
- Crow hasn't been developed for SWPPP complexity
- Might work for sweeping, water trucks (simpler service models)

### Step 7: Work Completes & Billing

* *Crew Documentation:**

- Crews write on schedule sheets
- Document: Quantities installed, time on site, any issues
- Return sheets to Jayson
- Quality of documentation varies
- "Like a charades game trying to figure out what they wrote"

* *Common Issues:**

- "Installed 25 screens" - was it 22 or 50? Supposed to be lineal feet
- "Pounded 10 new poles, 12 new poles" - two visits, need separate time entries
- Missing information requires Jayson follow-up

* *Jayson's Process:**

- Reviews returned schedule sheets
- Deciphers crew handwriting and notes
- Separates multiple visits if applicable
- Creates work complete entries
- Provides to billing (specific person not mentioned)

* *Coordination with Billing:**

- Kendra tracks when work complete received
- Excel schedule color-coded

  - Pink: Nothing done yet
  - Green: Work complete received
  - White/clear: Billed

- Jayson updates Excel when work done ("mark it in the green")
- Kendra bills when work complete arrives

* *Contract Billing Nuances:**

- Some items billed but not delivered yet
- Example: Narrative complete but not submitted
- Invoice includes narrative with memo "DO NOT SUBMIT"
- Tracks that work is ready even if not yet delivered
- Important when customers call asking if ready

## SWPPP SIGNS & STICKERS: SPECIAL PROCESS

### Background: Permit Change

* *New General Construction Permit (2025):**

- Previous permits expired in 2025
- New permits expire in 2030
- All existing sites need new ADEQ sticker with updated permit number
- Books need updated permit inserts (take out 2020, insert 2025 general construction permit)

* *Inspector-Triggered Process:**

- Herbie (inspector) identifies site needs new sticker
- Calls/emails Jayson
- Issue: Herbie didn't inform customer of cost
- "That would have been nice if Herbie just took care of that"

* *Current Multi-Person Process:**

1. Inspector identifies need
2. Jayson receives notification
3. Jayson must call customer to obtain approval
4. Jayson emails Karen requesting sign order
5. Karen orders from vendor
6. Wait ~5-10 days for delivery
7. Herbie installs sticker on site

* *Pain Point:**

- "Three people calling about sticker - should just be one"
- Inspector should

  - Inform customer of cost upfront
  - Obtain email approval
  - Send to Jayson with all info
  - Jayson orders, done

- Instead: Multiple people involved, bottleneck created

* *Sign Types:**

- SWPPP signs (main site identification)
- Dust control signs
- Fire signs (sometimes requested but not on estimate)
- Install on posts vs. on fence
- Pricing: ~$275 for SWPPP sign, ~$75 for sticker

- --

## INSPECTOR COORDINATION & DEFICIENCIES

### Inspector Roles

* *James, Logan, Herbie (sometimes):**

- Conduct site inspections per schedule
- Document deficiencies in reports
- Send reports to superintendent
- Supposed to facilitate corrective action

### Ideal Deficiency Process (Rarely Happens)

1. Inspector identifies deficiency during inspection
2. Inspector measures/quantifies: "600 feet of sock on north side"
3. Inspector takes photos of problem area
4. Inspector walks to job trailer, meets with superintendent
5. Inspector writes email to super right then, CCs Jayson
6. Email states: Deficiency found, quantity needed, see attached photos
7. Super replies "approved" in email
8. Jayson receives approval, has all info needed (quantity, location, photos)
9. Jayson schedules repair with all details

* *Why This Matters:**

- Eliminates bottlenecks
- Superintendent already aware (was there when email sent)
- Jayson has everything needed to schedule and quote
- "Pictures are a thousand words"
- Crew knows exactly what they're getting into

### Reality: Common Problems

* *Insufficient Information:**

- Inspector writes up deficiency without measurement
- Just says "fence down on east side"
- Superintendent calls: "I need fence fixed"
- Jayson: "How much?"
- Super: "I don't know, I was just there with Logan/Herbie"
- Jayson: "Did they give you a measurement?"
- Super: "No"
- Super gets angry: "You guys were out here"

* *Resulting Workflow:**

- Jayson must call inspector for details
- Inspector may or may not have documented
- Jayson estimates based on description
- Less accurate, more back-and-forth
- Super frustrated with process

* *Logan & Herbie Communication:**

- "James is good at it"
- "Herbie's kinda good at it"
- "Logan not so much"
- Inconsistent approach to deficiency documentation

* *Photo Documentation:**

- New Compliance Go app allows photos with reports
- "Logan's using it" - can attach photos to digital inspection
- Would be "perfect for all of them to use"
- Previous company 5-6 years ago had photos: "Could see runoff all over the golf course, knew exactly what to do"

### Ethical Boundaries

* *Cannot Sell Corrections:**

- "Fox and the hen house" situation
- Inspector can't write up deficiency then immediately sell repair
- Must wait for customer to request via email
- Protects company from conflict of interest appearance

* *Email Requirement:**

- All service requests must be in email
- Protects against non-payment disputes
- Don (billing) "fighting with people to get paid"
- Verbal agreements lead to blacklist situations

- --

## SYSTEMS & TOOLS

### QuickBooks

* *Primary Use:**

- Customer database
- Job tracking
- Estimate storage
- Email approval attachments
- Financial records for audits

* *Jayson's Workflow:**

- Searches for customers (sometimes under different names)
- Creates jobs under customers
- Attaches email approvals to protect against disputes
- Enters all work requests with documentation

* *Pain Point:**

- "There should be a way to take from QuickBooks and not retype all this"
- Duplicate data entry from estimates
- No easy import/export to other systems

### SharePoint

* *SWPPP Plans Folder:**

- Should contain all SWPPP plans from estimates
- Jared supposed to upload when estimate created
- Often missing - Jared using Monday.com instead
- "Monday has to go into here because this is how Kendra and all of us find shit"

* *Project Folders:**

- Organized by customer
- Subfolders for each project
- Contains: Scanned documents, NOIs, dust permits, plans
- Some customers A-M, N-Z separation

* *Issues:**

- Not everyone uploads consistently
- Information scattered between SharePoint and Monday.com
- "Until other thing comes up, keep using current system"

### Excel Task Tracking

* *Personal System:**

- Tracks all SWPPP books in progress
- Columns: Company, Project, Status, Date, Notes
- Color coding for status
- Updates as project progresses
- Moves to "completed" folder when done

* *Why Necessary:**

- No unified project tracking system
- Needs to see at-a-glance what's waiting vs. in progress
- Tracks who's responsible for delays (waiting for NOI, etc.)
- Can quickly answer customer questions about status

### Monday.com (Jared's System)

* *Problem:**

- Jared putting estimates and plans in Monday.com
- Other staff can't access
- Not integrated with QuickBooks
- Creates information silos
- "Monday needs to go into SharePoint so we can all see it"

### Email

* *Primary Communication Tool:**

- All approvals via email (required)
- Project coordination
- Information requests (NOI, dust permit, etc.)
- Work scheduling
- Problem: Results in 20+ email threads with multiple people

### Crow (Mentioned, Not Currently Used for SWPPP)

* *Potential:**

- Could dispatch SWPPP crews
- Issue: Complex work entry requirements
- Each job has many variables
- Needs "McDonald's app" simplicity
- "Almost needs to be like checkboxes - pickles, lettuce, mayonnaise"
- Works great for simple services (sweeping, water trucks)
- "Crow hasn't developed for SWPPP"

* *Current Use by Others:**

- Kelly (sweeping), Wendy (roll-offs), Steven (porta-johns)
- Can reactivate old jobs with all information
- Tracks service history
- Location-based search

* *Requirements for SWPPP:**

- Would need custom fields for

  - Feet of sock (lineal)
  - Fence type (pounded vs. stands)
  - Privacy screening (yes/no, height)
  - Sandbag quantity
  - Rock entrance size
  - Inlet types and quantities
  - Multiple visits to same site

- Currently no such system exists

- --

## KEY PROCESSES: CUSTOMER REQUESTS

### NOI Assistance Calls

* *Common Scenario:**

- Customer calls: "I need help pulling an NOI"
- Customers think Desert Services handles this
- Reality: NOIs pulled through ADEQ MyDEQ account

* *Jayson's Response:**

1. Explains process is through ADEQ, not Desert Services
2. Offers ADEQ help desk number: 844-827-4768
3. Explains they may need to leave message
4. Note: Used to have direct contacts, but COVID turnover eliminated those
5. Provides guidance on updating from 2020 to 2025 permit

* *Related: NOI Updates**

- Customer: "We need to update our NOI from 2020 permit"
- Process: Log into MyDEQ account, pull new permit
- Same as pulling new NOI
- Jayson can't do it for them - must be customer
- Can guide them through process

### Sign/Sticker Orders

* *Customer or Inspector Notification:**

- Example: "We need a new sticker for the updated permit"
- Cost: ~$75
- Must obtain email approval before ordering

* *Jayson's Process:**

1. Verify what's needed (new sign vs. sticker)
2. Confirm project details
3. Request email approval
4. Forward to Karen with NOI and project info
5. Karen orders from vendor
6. Timeline: "Probably take a couple days"
7. Inspector (Herbie) installs when received

* *Follow-up Customer Education:**

- "You'll want to print that new permit and put it in Appendix D"
- "Take the old 2020 general construction permit out"
- "Print new 2025 permit (30 pages) front-and-back"
- Customers often don't know these steps

### Emergency Installations

* *Scenario: Customer needs installation urgently**

- Example: "We need it yesterday" (actual customer quote)
- No contract yet, estimate in process

* *Requirements Before Proceeding:**

- MUST have email approval
- Need to know: What they want, how much, where
- Verify estimate exists and is accurate
- Create QuickBooks entry with approval attached

* *Coordination:**

- Check crew availability
- May not be possible same-day: "All my guys left for the day, been working since 3 AM"
- Set realistic timeline: "I won't be able to get there till Tuesday"
- Manage expectations vs. Desert Services reputation for responsiveness

### Rework Requests

* *Triggers:**

- Inspector deficiency
- Weather damage (wind, rain)
- Construction activity damage
- Normal wear and tear

* *Process:**

1. Superintendent calls or emails
2. Jayson asks: "What needs to be fixed? How much? Where?"
3. If inspector was involved, asks for their details
4. Gets email approval
5. Schedules crew
6. Sometimes customer "doesn't even want pricing, just wants it fixed"

* *Pricing:**

- Existing customers often have established pricing
- T&M (time and materials) common
- "How much sock do you want?" - quantity-based
- Rock entrance refresh: Depends on condition and size

- --

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### 1. Incomplete Handoffs from Estimating

* *Contract vs. Estimate Mismatches:**

- Dollar amounts don't align
- Line items added or removed
- Quantities changed
- "This should have all been matched up before it got to me"

* *Missing Information:**

- No NOI
- No dust permit
- No site contact
- No schedule
- No special site requirements
- "When contract is done, I should get a packet with everything"

* *Multiple Follow-ups Required:**

- "20 emails back and forth"
- Jared, Kendra, Jayson, customer all on thread
- Everyone's time wasted on reconciliation
- "All of us are on this email but we don't all need to be"

* *Impact:**

- Delays project start
- Customer frustration
- Inefficient use of time
- Information gaps lead to on-site problems

### 2. Scattered Information Systems

* *Monday.com vs. SharePoint vs. QuickBooks:**

- Jared putting estimates in Monday.com
- Rest of team can't access
- SWPPP plans should be in SharePoint
- Estimates should be in QuickBooks
- "Everybody should be able to see it, not just the way one person wants to do it"

* *No Centralized Project Repository:**

- NOIs scattered in email
- Dust permits in various folders
- Plans in multiple locations
- "Would be nice to have one spot for all project information"
- Currently: Jayson manually consolidates into working folders

* *Duplicate Data Entry:**

- Information in estimate
- Jayson re-types into QuickBooks
- Again into schedule sheets
- "Stupid to have to retype this when it's somewhere else"
- No clear way to import/export

### 3. Inspector Communication Gaps

* *Missing Details on Deficiencies:**

- No measurements provided
- No photos attached
- No location specificity
- Forces unnecessary follow-up

* *Inconsistent Processes:**

- James follows best practices
- Herbie "kinda good"
- Logan "not so much"
- No standardized approach

* *Superintendent Frustration:**

- "You guys were just here"
- "Why don't you know how much?"
- Makes Desert Services look disorganized
- Damages customer relationships

* *Proposed Solution:**

- Pictures mandatory: "Pictures are a thousand words"
- Measurements required before leaving site
- Email approval obtained on-site
- Example: "Like we did at Gardens - if we had a picture of that 700 feet and where it was, hand it to me, done"

### 4. Crew Communication Issues

* *Email Blindness:**

- Jayson sends weekend schedules via email
- Monday morning: "I didn't see the email"
- "You're supposed to look at your email every day"
- Crews don't check regularly

* *Work Complete Documentation:**

- Handwriting illegible
- Missing information
- "Like a charades game trying to figure out what they wrote"
- Requires follow-up to clarify

* *Site Coordination:**

- Supposed to call before arrival
- Supposed to text when job complete
- Supposed to report cancellations immediately
- Compliance varies

* *Lack of Real-Time Tracking:**

- No app to show crew locations
- Don't know job status until crew reports
- Can't see if jobs canceled until late
- "If we had BusyBusy like other divisions..."

### 5. Multiple People, No Clear Ownership

* *"Too Many Cooks":**

- Jayson discovers work on his schedule he didn't know about
- Sales made commitments, didn't inform operations
- Inspectors coordinating directly with customers
- Example: "I didn't know they need 600 feet of sock relocated"

* *Sticker Example:**

- Inspector calls about sticker need
- Jayson has to call customer
- Karen orders
- "Should be one person, one email, done"
- Instead: "Three people calling him about the sticker"

* *Multiple Entry Points:**

- Customers call Jayson directly
- Customers call sales
- Customers call inspectors
- Customers call office general line
- No single coordination point
- Information doesn't flow between channels

### 6. Schedule Creation Time Burden

* *Manual Process:**

- Create each job sheet individually
- Type all information (address, contact, scope)
- Print physical copies
- Often working until 6:30 PM
- "Can't get it done during day because I'm interrupted so much"

* *Frequent Changes:**

- Jobs cancel day-of
- "Two canceled today"
- Must reschedule for already-full days
- "Fucks up the next day's schedule"
- Try to fill gaps, often unsuccessful (Friday afternoons)

* *Prioritization Complexity:**

- Some jobs MUST be first thing AM
- Geographic routing for efficiency
- Customer urgency varies
- Crew capabilities differ (who has tractor, etc.)
- All must be considered simultaneously

### 7. Customer Education Gaps

* *Think We Do Everything:**

- "A lot of times I think we do it all"
- Customer: "Can you help me pull my NOI?"
- Customer thinks we handle ADEQ processes
- Must explain what's their responsibility vs. ours

* *Don't Know What They Have:**

- "Don't know they have a SWPPP plan"
- Budget for plan creation
- "Jared or Jason will tell me they found one"
- Kendra: "I don't understand how they don't know"

* *Permit Updates:**

- Don't know about 2020→2025 transition
- Don't know how to update books
- Jayson provides guidance but takes time

## CONCLUSION

Jayson Roti operates as the critical hub connecting estimating, field operations, inspectors, billing, and customers in the SWPPP service line. His role requires constant context-switching between project delivery (book creation, installations), coordination (schedules, approvals), and firefighting (missing information, deficiency responses, urgent requests). The position is characterized by:

* *Strengths:**

- Deep process knowledge ("all in my head")
- Customer service commitment (responsive despite volume)
- Multi-system fluency (QuickBooks, SharePoint, Excel, Crow awareness)
- Quality focus (careful narrative reviews)
- Relationship management (inspectors, crews, supers)

* *Systemic Challenges:**

- Scattered information across non-integrated systems
- Incomplete handoffs from estimating requiring extensive follow-up
- Manual data entry and duplicate information capture
- Inspector communication inconsistency creating bottlenecks
- Lack of real-time crew tracking/communication
- Email-based coordination at scale
- Manual schedule creation consuming evening hours

* *Highest Impact Opportunities:**

1. **Standardized Estimating Handoff:** Eliminate 20-email reconciliation threads, faster project starts
2. **Inspector Photo/Measurement Mandate:** Remove deficiency coordination bottleneck, improve super satisfaction
3. **Unified Project Repository:** Single source of truth accessible to all departments
4. **Digital Crew Dispatch:** Real-time tracking, automated work completes, reduced manual coordination
5. **Automated Schedule Generation:** Reclaim evening hours, reduce transcription errors

The role demonstrates both the value of institutional knowledge and the cost of process dependency on individual expertise. Systematizing Jayson's workflows would improve efficiency, reduce stress, enable scaling, and protect business continuity while maintaining the customer responsiveness that defines Desert Services' SWPPP reputation.
