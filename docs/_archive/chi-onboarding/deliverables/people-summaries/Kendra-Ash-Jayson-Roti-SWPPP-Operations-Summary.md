# Kendra-Jayson SWPPP Operations Meeting Notes - Final

* *Meeting Date:** October 2024
* *Participants:** Chi Ejimofor, Kendra Ash (Billing/Contracts), Jayson Roti (SWPPP Operations/Delivery Manager)
* *Purpose:** Understand SWPPP operations workflow, billing processes, and cross-functional coordination

- --

## Executive Summary

These meetings documented the complete SWPPP project lifecycle at Desert Services, from contract award through billing and closeout. The sessions revealed a complex, highly manual workflow with significant communication bottlenecks, manual data entry across multiple systems (QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets, email), and unclear handoffs between estimating, operations, and billing. Key opportunities include implementing project management structure, centralizing contract information, automating redundant data entry, and establishing clear process ownership for contract review and precommunication.

* *Critical Findings:**

* No centralized project management or contract coordination role
* Contract details scattered across QuickBooks, email, Excel, and SharePoint
* 20+ email chains to resolve basic contract questions
* Billing occurs before contracts are finalized or even received
* Manual data entry duplicated across 4-5 systems per project
* No inventory tracking for rentals (temp fence, grates, backflows)
* QuickBooks inadequate for construction contracting needs

## Overview of Roles

### Kendra Ash - Billing & Contracts Manager

* *Primary Responsibilities:**

* SWPPP, temp fence, and rental billing (invoicing and contract billing)
* Contract review, negotiation, and signing (only person who signs contracts)
* Schedule of values setup for contract billing platforms
* Insurance certificate coordination (with Dawn)
* CSIP/OCIP monthly reporting
* Change order requests and follow-up
* Payment receipt and application
* Lien waiver processing

* *Systems Used:** QuickBooks, Textura, GC Pay, Procore, Premier, Sightline (AIA), Excel (rental master, billing tracking)

* *Major Pain Points:**

* Contracts arrive incomplete or mismatched with estimates
* Must chase customers for months to get change orders approved
* Cannot update QuickBooks memos after month-end close (audit requirement)
* Billing platforms not set up in time (one job waited 10 months for Textura access)
* Constant interruptions for "urgent" requests prevent systematic billing work
* No time to proactively follow up on outstanding items

* SWPPP scheduling and installation coordination
* SWPPP narrative and book preparation (with Eva)
* Sign ordering and tracking (with Karen)
* Rock entrance coordination (ordering rock, scheduling Dalton/Daniel)
* Customer pre-installation communication
* Inspector coordination and deficiency management
* Work completion documentation for billing
* Email approvals and QuickBooks documentation (audit requirements)

* *Systems Used:** QuickBooks, Excel (master schedule, task tracking), SharePoint (SWPPP plans, permits, NOIs), email, Crow (water meters - Daniel's work)

* *Major Pain Points:**

* Contracts arrive without critical details matched to estimates
* Must retype information into multiple systems (QuickBooks, Excel, work orders)
* 20+ emails per project to resolve basic questions (what do they want, how much, when)
* SWPPP plans stored inconsistently (Monday vs. SharePoint vs. not at all)
* Interruptions prevent systematic schedule building
* No centralized repository for job documents (NOIs, dust permits, plans)
* Inspector communication inconsistent (pictures, measurements, deficiency details)

## SWPPP Project Lifecycle (From Contract to Billing)

### Phase 1: Estimate & Award

* *Current State:**

1. **Estimate Request Received** → Goes to Jared (Chief Estimator), sometimes via Building Connected or other bid platforms
2. **Estimate Created** → Jared creates estimate, stores in QuickBooks under "Estimating Department" (if no specific customer yet) or under customer name
3. **Estimate Submitted** → Sent to multiple GCs if public bid, or specific customer
4. **Award Notification** → NO STANDARD PROCESS

    * Can come via email, phone call, contract, or verbal communication
    * Can go to: Jared, Kendra, any delivery manager (Jayson, Rick, Brandon, Lacey), sales team, Dawn, Karen (occasionally)
    * Often no formal notification - just assumptions based on customer communication

* *Problems:**

* No single point of contact for award notifications
* No tracking system for who has been notified
* Unclear if work should begin or wait for contract

* *What Should Happen (Kendra's Input):**

* Whoever receives award notification should inform Jared
* Jared should verify estimate matches contract
* Contract should be sent to contracts email for review BEFORE any work begins
* Reality: "Everyone needs us on site first before they can do anything else, so there are very few contractors that will make sure they get contracts out to us... it's actually more along the lines of we're on site before we ever get a contract."

### Phase 2: Contract Receipt & Review

* *Current State:**

1. **Contract Arrives** → Typically to Jared via email (sometimes Kendra, sometimes directors)
2. **Jared's Review** → Supposed to:

    * Verify dollar amount matches estimate
    * Check basic scope alignment
    * Forward to contracts@email with estimate attached

3. **Contracts Email Recipients** → Everyone on distribution list receives:

    * Operations team (Jayson, other delivery managers)
    * Billing (Kendra)
    * Estimating (Jared)
    * Sometimes inspection team (if inspections included)
    * Sometimes Karen (if signs included)

4. **Operations Review** → Supposed to check if they're involved by reviewing attached estimate

    * Problem: Project naming often different between estimate and contract
    * Problem: No one systematically checks - people don't read full contracts

5. **Kendra's Review** → Must review for:

    * Dollar amount match
    * Line item discrepancies
    * Billing requirements (invoice vs. contract, platform type)
    * Insurance requirements
    * Schedule of values requirements
    * Items added that weren't in estimate
    * Items missing from contract that were in estimate
    * Retention percentage
    * Payment terms and billing schedule

6. **Back-and-Forth Negotiation** → Kendra sends back to customer for corrections

    * "Normally I have to send it back to the customer and have things changed pretty much all the time"
    * Customers often don't respond quickly unless they need work started immediately
    * If work already installed before contract received, even harder to get changes

7. **Contract Signing** → Kendra signs all contracts (only person authorized)

8. **QuickBooks Entry** → Kendra creates job, attaches contract and estimate, updates estimate location

* *Problems:**

* "It's kind of a mess" - everyone receives everything, whether relevant or not
* Jeff Gardner used to filter and send only to relevant people - no longer happens
* Contract often doesn't match estimate due to customer changes
* No systematic contract review process
* Can take weeks/months of back-and-forth to finalize
* Kendra: "I'm the one who has to sign the contracts and I hate reading them"
* Work often starts before contract is finalized or even received

* *Jayson's Perspective:**

* "A lot of this stuff is like new because of the way accounting is being done. Before it used to be we just got email proof that we were good, they didn't have to go into QuickBooks."
* Needs all contract details matched up before receiving work package
* "That dollar amount should match before we even get anything"
* Currently receiving contracts via email blast where "the dollar amount's off and this dollar amount's off"
* "I don't need to see those emails until all the negotiating is done"

### Phase 3: Precommunication & Documentation Requests

* *What SHOULD Happen (According to both Kendra and Jayson):**
Once contract is finalized, immediate communication to customer requesting:

1. **NOI (Notice of Intent)** - REQUIRED

    * Should be pulled by GC immediately
    * Desert Services needs copy for SWPPP narrative and book
    * Often GC hasn't pulled it yet or doesn't understand they need it
    * Alternative: NDC (No Discharge Permit) - if they pull this instead, Desert Services cannot make SWPPP book and sign (less revenue)

2. **Dust Control Permit** - REQUIRED (over 2 acres)

    * Can be pulled by GC or Desert Services
    * Needed for SWPPP narrative location mapping
    * Jared can pull for customers (billable service)

3. **SWPPP Plan** - REQUIRED

    * Should come from GC (if they have engineer prepare it)
    * If not, Desert Services can create (Jared handles or outsources)
    * Problem: "A lot of times customers don't know they have a plan"
    * Sometimes found later: "We'd be like they already have a plan"
    * Must be in SharePoint SWPPP Plans folder for Eva and Jayson to access
    * Currently sometimes goes to Monday.com instead (Jared's workflow) - NOT ACCESSIBLE to operations

4. **Site Contact Information**

    * Superintendent name and phone number
    * Site address
    * Gate codes
    * Site access requirements (badging, PPE, parking restrictions, hours)

5. **Installation Details/Readiness Questions:**

    * Are inlets already installed?
    * Is temp fence already up?
    * Are they ready for sock (compost filter sock)?
    * Are they ready for rock entrance?
    * Has grading been done for rock entrance? (should be, usually isn't)
    * Temp fence details: pounded, stands, or half-and-half? Privacy screening needed?
    * How much of each BMP item? (should match estimate but often doesn't)

* *Current Reality:**

* "Right when we get the contract, we should ask this" (NOI, dust permit)
* Communication happens via email from Jayson, Karen, or sometimes Kendra
* Often delayed because everyone is waiting for contract
* Often incomplete because customer doesn't understand requirements
* Jayson: "If we could go out and ask all those questions and then hand it to me I'd already have it all"
* Multiple people asking same questions creates confusion

* *Problems Identified:**

* No single owner of precommunication process
* Same questions asked by multiple people (Jayson, Jared, Kendra, Karen)
* Critical information scattered across email threads
* SWPPP plans not consistently stored in accessible location
* Contract variations not communicated clearly to operations

### Phase 4: SWPPP Book & Narrative Preparation

* *Process (Jayson + Eva):**

1. **Information Gathering** (Jayson)

    * Creates folder in personal tracking system with

      * NOI from customer
      * Dust control permit
      * SWPPP plan (if available from Jared or customer)
      * Site information

    * Tracks in Excel task list by project with status (waiting for NOI, in progress, complete)
    * Wishes for centralized database with all project documents accessible to everyone

2. **Narrative Creation** (Eva + Jayson)

    * Eva uses Word templates to create narrative
    * Must customize with project-specific information

      * Project name, address, billing address
      * Site contact information
      * Acreage (pulled from NOI)
      * Site location mapping (from dust permit or SWPPP plan)
      * Soils report (pulled from USDA website - manual lookup by parcel)
      * Endangered species report (pulled from AZ Game & Fish website)
      * Inspector names (Logan, James, Herve)
      * All sections must reference 2025 permit (updated from 2020)

    * Process: "Replace all" for project names throughout template, customize variable sections
    * Time: 1.5 - 2 hours per narrative (Jayson: "I used to do like 20 of these on a weekend")

3. **Book Assembly**

    * Front section: Eva's customized narrative
    * Appendices (mostly boilerplate)

      * General Construction Permit (2025 version - 30 pages)
      * NOI
      * Dust control permit
      * SWPPP plan
      * Soils report
      * Endangered species report
      * Section M: All possible BMPs (best management practices) - standard across all books

    * Eva prints customized sections
    * Jayson reviews for accuracy

      * Correct NOI number
      * Correct addresses
      * Acreage matches
      * Soils map matches parcel
      * 2025 permit referenced throughout (not 2020)
      * Proper page breaks (each section starts new page)
      * Correct items included (no silt fence if not needed, etc.)

    * Jayson assembles physical book with boilerplate sections from pre-printed stock

4. **Special Cases**

    * **MT Builders Requirement:** Must scan entire completed book to PDF for digital delivery

      * Most customers don't require this
      * Protective measure: "If you scan it as a PDF, the whole thing's a PDF vs putting it all together" - harder to manipulate
      * Reason: "They could tear this apart and then they don't need us to do this stuff later on"

    * **EPA NOI Books:** Different format, less common, charged more

5. **Tracking & Handoff**

    * Jayson updates Excel task tracker when book complete
    * Marked as "done" in his system with completion date
    * Delivered by inspector when they're in area OR held for scheduled delivery
    * Moved to "completed" folder in Jayson's tracking when delivered
    * Kendra marked on SWPPP master spreadsheet when book delivered

* *Problems:**

* SWPPP plans not in SharePoint consistently (sometimes in Monday, sometimes not saved)
* "A lot of times I have to hunt for it" - Jayson
* Manual data entry from multiple sources (NOI, dust permit, plan)
* No automation possible for soils reports or endangered species
* Waiting for information delays book completion
* Customers often confused about what they need to provide

### Phase 5: Signs & Permits

* *Sign Types:**

1. **SWPPP Sign** - Required on all projects

    * Shows SWPPP contact information
    * Must have current ASCON permit number (2025 version)
    * Old signs need new stickers with updated permit number
    * Usually installed on posts, sometimes on fence

2. **Dust Control Sign** - Required on projects over 2 acres

    * Shows dust control permit information

3. **Fire Lane Signs** - If required by customer/jurisdiction

    * Not always needed

* *Process:**

* Karen orders signs from vendor (outsourced)
* Needs NOI information for SWPPP sign
* Needs dust permit information for dust sign
* Needs fire sign specifications from customer
* Jayson sends information to Karen via email
* Karen manages vendor relationship
* Signs delivered to office, then dispatched with installation crew or inspector

* *Sticker Updates (New 2025 Permit):**

* Old SWPPP signs in field have 2020 permit numbers
* ADEQ updated general construction permit in 2025
* Inspector (Herve) identifies signs needing updates during inspections
* Triggers work order for new sticker
* Customer billed for new sticker (~$75)
* Jayson needs email approval before ordering
* Karen orders sticker with new ASCON permit number
* Inspector installs sticker on next visit

* *Problems:**

* Multiple people involved (Jayson, Karen, customer, inspector)
* Inspector should handle approval request upfront but doesn't always
* Result: "Three people calling about the sticker... it should just be one, just send an email and we're done"

### Phase 6: Installation Scheduling

* *Pre-Installation:**

1. **Contract Verification** (Ideally)

    * Estimate matched to contract
    * All line items confirmed
    * All details confirmed (amounts, types, specifications)

2. **Readiness Confirmation** (Jayson calls superintendent)

    * Day before scheduled install
    * Questions asked

      * Are you ready for installation?
      * Temp fence: Are poles pounded or on stands? Privacy screening needed?
      * Inlets: Are they installed yet? (If new construction, probably not)
      * Rock entrance: Has site been graded? Are curbs in place?
      * SOC (compost filter sock): Is temp fence up? (Should go up first to avoid damage)

    * If not ready: Reschedule to next available day
    * Jayson: "A lot of times I'll have in here... 'They're ready for the sock' or 'At a later date'"

3. **Special Coordination - Rock Entrance**

    * Requires rock delivery same day as installation
    * Daniel or Dalton calls rock supplier (morning of install)
    * Confirms truck availability
    * Supplier delivers to site
    * Dalton/Daniel uses tractor to spread rock
    * Typical process: Grade 4-6 inches deep, 30ft wide x 50ft long, place filter fabric, dump truck pours, tractor spreads
    * Time: 2-2.5 hours (could be 1 hour if site properly prepped)
    * Charged by the hour
    * Problem: "Should be graded, never is. DS has to do grading"
    * Ideal: "Conversation that could be had in advance" about prep requirements

* *Schedule Building Process:**

1. **Daily Throughout Week** (Jayson)

    * Receives install requests via email, phone, contract
    * Enters into QuickBooks (for audit trail)
    * Enters into Excel master schedule
    * Problem: "This is duplicating it. If there was a system that would make it go faster..."
    * Manually types

      * Customer name
      * Job name/address
      * Site contact name and number
      * Gate code
      * Work description (what to install, how much, special notes)
      * Date needed

    * Color codes by status

      * Pink = Scheduled, not completed
      * Green = Completed, ready to bill
      * White = Billed and verified

2. **Work Order Printing** (End of day, usually by 6:30pm)

    * Jayson prints individual work orders for each job
    * Each contains

      * Customer name
      * Site address
      * Site contact and phone
      * Work description with specific quantities and details
      * Special notes (gate codes, site requirements)

    * "This takes some time to do"
    * Sometimes sent via email to supervisors over weekend
    * Problem: "Joel, Justin, and those guys never check their email"

3. **Morning Dispatch**

    * Work orders at office OR supervisors check email
    * Joel (SWPPP supervisor), Justin, Jair/Preston (crew leads)
    * Prioritization

      * First job = Most urgent (e.g., "Clayco - has to be first thing in the morning")
      * Other jobs filled in by geography and availability
      * "Depending on priority" if jobs get pushed

* *Installation Day:**

1. **Pre-Install Call** (Crew lead or supervisor)

    * Calls superintendent to confirm ready
    * Final verification of what's needed
    * Jayson: "Supervisors/crew leads/director call first to check if ready as final check"
    * If not ready: Call Jayson, reschedule

2. **Installation**

    * Typical crew: 2-person teams
    * Joel + Alfredo, Justin + Haiti, Jair + others (now Preston)
    * Install BMPs per work order

3. **Completion Documentation**

    * Crew writes work completed on work order
    * Jayson: "Sometimes it's like a charades game trying to figure out what they wrote down"
    * Examples of unclear documentation

      * "Installed 25 screens" (should be linear feet)
      * "10 new 12 new poles" (unclear what this means)
      * Two visits on one work order (need to separate for billing)

4. **Communication Issues**

    * Crews supposed to text Jayson when job done
    * Often don't
    * Jayson doesn't know status without app/tracking system
    * Last-minute cancellations not communicated
    * "If we had an app like Crow I can start seeing where they're at"

* *Problems:**

* Same information typed into QuickBooks AND Excel AND work orders (3x data entry)
* Work orders printed daily (very late) due to interruptions
* Email schedule changes not read by crews
* No real-time status visibility
* Last-minute cancellations waste time (especially Fridays when supers want to go home)
* Cannot easily fill schedule gaps from cancellations
* Prioritization mostly manual based on Jayson's judgment

### Phase 7: Rework & Maintenance

* *Triggers for Rework:**

1. **Inspector Findings** (Desert Services inspectors - James, Logan, Herve)

    * During routine SWPPP inspections
    * Find deficiencies (damaged fence, compromised sock, dirty rock entrance, unprotected inlets)
    * Supposed to: Take pictures, measure quantities, get superintendent approval, email Jayson
    * Current reality: Often don't take pictures or get measurements
    * Jayson: "If we would have had a picture of that 700 feet where it's at... this one person that's done, that's over with, we just hand it over to me or whoever it is"

2. **Direct Calls from GC**

    * Superintendent calls Desert Services directly
    * Can go to: Jayson, sales people, inspectors, directors
    * Sometimes just wants it fixed ASAP: "Sometimes they don't even want pricing, they just want it fixed"

3. **Regulatory Inspector Findings** (ADEQ, City inspectors)

    * Write up GC for deficiencies
    * GC contacts Desert Services for repairs
    * Often urgent

* *Process:**

1. Communication to Jayson (email or call)
2. Jayson needs:

    * What needs fixing
    * How much (linear feet, number of inlets, etc.)
    * Where on site (pictures ideal)
    * Approval to proceed (email from superintendent or sales rep)
3. Jayson schedules rework
4. Crew dispatched
5. Work completed, documented, billed

* *Problems:**

* Inspector communication inconsistent
* Pictures and measurements often missing
* Multiple people involved = bottleneck
* Jayson: "Three people not getting involved in it. One person that gets a call could just take care of it all"
* Compliance Pro app (being rolled out by Logan in Tucson) should improve by requiring pictures and descriptions

### Phase 8: Inspections

* *Requirements:**

* Supposed to start within 2 weeks of NOI being filed
* Reality: Don't start until dirt work begins because customers won't pay for inspections of untouched ground
* Frequency: Typically weekly or bi-weekly (specified in contract)
* Inspector delivers SWPPP book during one of first visits if not already delivered

* *Inspector Process:**

1. Visit site per schedule
2. Check all BMPs (fence, sock, rock entrance, inlet protection, etc.)
3. Take photos (Compliance Pro app will require this)
4. Document deficiencies
5. Email report to customer
6. If major deficiencies: Get superintendent approval for repairs, notify Jayson

* *Coordination:**

* Jayson sends SWPPP master spreadsheet to inspectors
* Shows all active jobs, addresses, contacts, inspection schedules
* Inspectors update with deliveries, findings
* Feed back to Jayson and Kendra for billing

* *Problems:**

* Inspectors not consistently taking detailed photos/measurements
* Communication gaps when deficiencies found
* "James and Herve are good at customer stuff and knowing the issue, SWPPP inspectors should be taking pictures of the issues and sending that"

### Phase 9: Billing

* *Two Paths: Invoice vs. Contract Billing**

* *Invoice Billing (~40-50% of SWPPP work):**

* One-time projects
* Customers who prefer invoice over contract billing
* Monthly rental items (temp fence, grates, backflows, water ramps, donkeys, hoses)

* *Process:**

1. Jayson marks work complete on master schedule (removes pink, no color = ready to bill)
2. Kendra reviews Excel master schedule
3. Creates invoice in QuickBooks
4. Sends invoice to customer
5. Customer pays (hopefully)
6. Kendra applies payment
7. Moves to "Billed and Verified" tab on master schedule

* *Simple:** "Obviously all you have to do is put an invoice together and send it which is really easy and we wish everything was by invoice but it's not"

* *Contract Billing (~50-60% of SWPPP work):**

* *Platforms Used:**

* **Textura** (most common)
* **GC Pay**
* **Procore**
* **Premier** (newer, "terrible")
* **Sightline** (for manual AIAs when customer doesn't use platform)
* Legacy: Manual AIA forms (done by hand before platforms)

* *Billing Frequency:**

* Once per month
* Customer sets billing window (typically 10th-25th of month)
* Must wait for customer to "open" billing in their system

* *Process:**

1. **Setup Phase** (First bill for new project)

    * Customer sets up project in their platform (Textura, GC Pay, etc.)
    * Kendra receives email notification (auto-generated from platform)
    * Kendra creates "Schedule of Values" breaking contract into line items
    * Submits schedule of values to customer for approval
    * Problem: Can take MONTHS - "We started work in December of last year, still aren't even set up in Textura till today" (October)
    * Some customers (Ryan Companies) set up schedule of values themselves

2. **Monthly Billing Cycle**

    * Kendra reviews Jayson's Excel master schedule for completed work (no color = bill it)
    * Reviews QuickBooks estimate to verify scope and pricing
    * Creates invoice in QuickBooks (even though billing through platform)

      * Marks "Not Submit" in memo field
      * Adds all work completed that month

    * Logs into platform (Textura/GC Pay/Procore/Premier)
    * Enters quantities completed against schedule of values
    * Platform calculates invoice amount
    * Submits billing
    * Customer reviews and approves (or rejects)

3. **Complications**

    * **Retention:** Customers hold back 5-10% (sometimes 7.5%, sometimes changes mid-project)
    * **Change Orders:** Work not in original contract requires change order approval

      * Kendra identifies during billing: "Oh shit I can't because this wasn't even on the contract"
      * Emails customer requesting change order
      * Customers often don't respond for months
      * "We might have change orders sitting there for... that happens all the time, very very often"

    * **Rejections:** Customer kicks back billing with corrections needed

      * Retention percentage changed
      * Items not approved
      * Documentation missing

    * **Missing Items:** Work done that wasn't in contract

      * Example: Rock entrance added but not in estimate
      * Must determine if it should have been included or is legitimate add

    * **Insurance Issues:** Payment held until insurance certificates current

      * "They start threatening and they won't pay us"
      * Urgent coordination with Dawn/Eva

4. **QuickBooks Management Problems**

    * Kendra creates invoice in QuickBooks even though billing through platform (duplicate entry)
    * Memo field used to track: "Submitted in Textura 10/8"
    * Cannot update memo after Don closes month (audit requirement)
    * "Now we don't know what's been billed where when"
    * Receivables report useless due to retention: "Thousands and thousands of outstanding invoices because they look like they're past due but really it's just retention"

5. **Payment Receipt**

    * Payments come through platform (Textura/GC Pay/etc.) - go directly to Kendra
    * OR checks mailed - go to Dawn
    * Dawn and Kendra both receive EFT notifications
    * Must coordinate to know what's been paid
    * Apply payment in QuickBooks
    * Track retention separately (manually)

* *Rental Billing (Separate Process):**

* Tracked in "Customer Rental Master" Excel spreadsheet
* Temp fence, grates, water ramps, water donkeys, hoses, backflows
* Columns: Customer, contact, start date, item type, quantity, billing through date
* Sorted monthly, billed for another month
* Problem: Quantities not tracked in spreadsheet - must look up in QuickBooks invoice history
* Temp fence quantities change frequently (more added, some removed)
* "It changes so often... we do not keep it updated in here"
* When done: Cut and paste to "Billed and Verified" tab

* *Major Billing Issues Identified:**

1. **Timing Mismatch**

    * Work often completed before contract received
    * Billing platforms not set up for months after work starts
    * Cannot bill until platform access granted
    * Change orders required for work already completed

2. **Information Gaps**

    * Kendra doesn't know work is completed until reviewing schedule
    * Discovers items not in contract only at billing time
    * No advance warning of scope changes
    * "It's always a surprise because I have no idea what we're doing until I go to bill for it"

3. **Change Order Process**

    * No proactive change order management
    * Kendra requests change orders monthly when billing
    * Customers often ignore requests
    * "I only ask them like once a month when I go to bill"
    * Can take 4+ months to get change order approved
    * Kendra: "Even if I have time to follow up I don't really have time to follow up"

4. **System Limitations**

    * QuickBooks not designed for construction contractors
    * Cannot track retention separately
    * Cannot generate useful receivables report
    * Invoice/contract billing distinction unclear in reporting
    * No subcontractor module (not needed but affects available features)

5. **Process Ownership**

    * No project manager role to own change orders
    * Kendra handles alone: "I'm the only one who must take care of all of it"
    * Software vendors ask: "Your project managers have to get in here and approve change order requests"
    * Kendra: "Yeah no, we don't have any of that, don't have any of those processes"

* *What Should Happen (Per Industry Standard):**

* Project managers/coordinators own their projects
* PM requests change orders proactively when scope changes
* PM follows up with customer
* PM coordinates with billing to ensure smooth monthly billing
* Billing receives clean information, bills accurately
* Kendra: "That's normally how it works... I'm the only one... every company that talks to me is like 'so how come?'"

## Scheduling & Operations (Jayson's Domain)

### Daily Workflow

* *Morning:**

* Check emails for new requests, changes, cancellations
* Field calls from customers, superintendents, sales team
* Confirm installs with crew leads (Joel, Justin, Jair/Preston)
* Coordinate rock deliveries (if rock entrance scheduled)
* Update schedules based on overnight changes

* *Throughout Day:**

* Phone calls from customers ("Does this happen all the time? Non-stop")
* Contract review requests (when new contracts come in)
* Inspector coordination (deficiency reports, delivery requests)
* Sign ordering coordination (with Karen)
* NOI assistance (helping customers navigate ADEQ website and My DEQ portal)
* QuickBooks entries (approvals, documentation for audits)
* Excel schedule updates
* SWPPP narrative reviews (checking Eva's work)
* Customer readiness calls (for upcoming installs)

* *End of Day (Often until 6:30pm):**

* Build next day's schedule
* Print work orders
* Email schedules to supervisors
* Update tracking systems
* Follow up on incomplete items

* *Interruptions:**

* "I'm showing him all the process... all the stuff that's coming in as phone calls"
* Cannot build schedules systematically due to constant interruptions
* "Sometimes I'm not in here till 6:30 trying to get this shit out"

### Systems & Tools

* *QuickBooks:**

* Customer/job setup
* Estimate storage and retrieval
* Contract attachment
* Email approval storage (audit requirement)
* Invoice creation
* Notes and communication tracking

* *Excel Spreadsheets:**

1. **Master Schedule (SWPPP Installs)**

    * Columns: Date, customer, job name, site contact, phone, address, gate code, work description, work completed, billing status
    * Color coding: Pink (scheduled), Green (completed, ready to bill), White (billed)
    * Separate tabs: Need to Schedule, Confirmed Schedule, Billed and Verified

2. **Task Tracking (SWPPP Books/Narratives)**

    * Tracks projects needing books
    * Status: Waiting for NOI, Waiting for Plan, In Progress, Complete
    * Notes on what's needed, when info received
    * Project moved to "Complete" folder when done

3. **Rental Master** (Kendra manages but Jayson references)

    * Tracks temp fence, grates, backflows, water ramps/donkeys

* *SharePoint:**

* SWPPP Plans folder (where plans SHOULD be stored)
* Dust permits folder
* NOI folder (for projects Desert Services manages)
* SWPPP narrative templates
* Boilerplate documents

* *Email:**

* Primary communication tool
* Customer approvals
* Inspector reports
* Internal coordination
* Problem: "Everything is in email" vs. centralized system

* *Personal Tracking:**

* Physical folders for active SWPPP books with gathered documents
* Notes on work orders
* Manual cross-referencing between systems

### Resource Management

* *Crew Assignments:**

* Joel (supervisor) + Alfredo
* Justin + Haiti
* Jair/Preston + rotating crew members
* Daniel/Dalton for rock entrance (tractor required)

* *Equipment Needs:**

* Temp fence panels (inventory not tracked consistently)
* Compost filter sock (inventory not tracked)
* Rock for entrances (ordered same-day)
* Grates, backflows, water ramps/donkeys (rental fleet - tracked in Excel)
* Tractors (Dalton/Daniel)
* Trucks (various)

* *Capacity Planning:**

* No formal system
* Jared "should know" fence capacity
* "We should know how much fence we have"
* Must physically count fence before big jobs
* If not enough: Order more (Jared handles)
* No tracking of what's committed to upcoming jobs

* *Inventory Problems:**

* "How much temp fence do we have right now? How much temp fence do we own? No way to know"
* Fence quantities on job sites change frequently (additions, removals)
* Not tracked in rental master spreadsheet
* Must review QuickBooks invoice history for each job to determine current quantities
* No way to forecast needs: "No way to forecast material wise or people wise on anything"

## Billing & Financial Management (Kendra's Domain)

### Billing Volume & Scope

* *Services Billed:**

* SWPPP (installations, inspections, narratives, books, signs)
* Temp fence (installations, relocations, removals, monthly rentals)
* Rentals (grates, backflows, water ramps, water donkeys, hoses)

* *Billing Types:**

* Invoice billing: ~40% (SWPPP), ~90% (rolloff/portajohn), ~70-75% (water truck/sweeper)
* Contract billing: ~60% (SWPPP), ~10% (rolloff/portajohn), ~25-30% (water truck/sweeper)
* "Depends on the customer... depends on which job and the project manager"

* *Volume:**

* "Hundreds and hundreds of contract billings a month"
* Monthly billing cycle for most contract work
* Continuous invoice generation for non-contract work
* 10 contracts per week at peak (recently slower)

### Contract Platforms

* *Company-Level Setup:**

* **Textura:** Company profile exists, auto-adds jobs, email notifications to Kendra
* **GC Pay:** Company profile exists, customer adds jobs
* **Premier:** Company profile exists (newer platform, "terrible")
* **Procore:** Individual invites per project
* **Sightline:** For manual AIA creation when customer doesn't use other platforms

* *Access:**

* Most platforms: Just need customer to add Desert Services to project (dropdown selection)
* Kendra's email automatically notified
* Should be simple: "Drop down box, check us, put in dollar amount, you're done"
* Reality: Can take months for customer to add them

### Schedule of Values

* *What It Is:**

* Breakdown of contract amount into billable line items
* Required for all contract billing platforms
* Tracks: Original amount, previous billings, current billing, balance
* Customer must approve before first billing

* *Kendra's Process:**

1. Review contract for all line items
2. Review estimate for quantities and pricing
3. Create line items in platform:

    * Installation (mob, sock, fence, rock entrance, signs, etc.)
    * Inspections (weekly/bi-weekly quantity)
    * Narratives, books
    * Rentals
4. Assign dollar values from contract to each line
5. Submit to customer for approval
6. Adjust if customer requests changes

* *Challenges:**

* Contract and estimate often don't match
* Items in contract not in estimate (or vice versa)
* Must request change orders before billing can begin
* Platform may not be set up for months: "December of last year... still aren't even set up in Textura"
* Some customers (Ryan Companies) set up schedule of values themselves

### Change Order Management

* *Triggers:**

1. **Scope additions** (customer requests more work not in contract)
2. **Contract omissions** (work in estimate not in contract)
3. **Quantity overages** (did more than contracted amount)
4. **Contract errors** (items listed that shouldn't be there)

* *Current Process:**

1. Kendra identifies during monthly billing review
2. Sends email to customer requesting change order
3. Waits for response (often weeks/months)
4. Follows up once per month when billing
5. Eventually receives change order (or doesn't)
6. Updates contract in QuickBooks
7. Updates schedule of values in platform
8. Bills additional amount

* *Problems:**

* No proactive change order process
* Discovered only at billing time (too late)
* Customers don't respond: "They might just ignore me for another four months"
* Kendra has no time for follow-up: "I don't really have time to follow up"
* Work already completed, harder to negotiate
* "That's the kind of thing that shouldn't happen, we should know ahead of time"

* *What Should Happen:**

* Project manager identifies scope change when it happens
* PM requests change order before work performed
* PM follows up until approved
* Billing receives approved change order, updates schedule, bills cleanly

### Payment Management

* *Payment Receipt:**

* **Platform Payments:** Come directly to Kendra (Textura, GC Pay, Procore, Premier)
* **Check Payments:** Go to Dawn
* **EFT Payments:** Notifications to both Dawn and Kendra
* Must coordinate to avoid duplicate entry

* *Payment Timing:**

* Contract billing: Typically 60 days after submission (submit in October, paid in December)
* Invoice billing: Varies by customer (30-60 days typical)
* Can be delayed for

  * Insurance certificates not current
  * Lien waivers not signed
  * Billing rejected/corrections needed
  * Customer payment holds (disputes, budget issues)

* *Retention:**

* Typically 10% held back
* Sometimes 5%, sometimes 7.5%, occasionally other amounts
* Can change during project: "One of my jobs just went down to 1 percent"
* Held until project completion (can be years)
* Released at closeout (sometimes partial releases)
* Makes QuickBooks receivables report unusable: "Can't print a receivables report... thousands of outstanding invoices... it's just retention, not past due"

* *Lien Waivers:**

* Required for payment on most projects
* Sign to waive lien rights for amounts being paid
* Kendra signs
* Platform usually integrates this (Textura)
* One of the "distractions" from core billing work

### CSIP/OCIP (Insurance Programs)

* *What It Is:**

* **CSIP:** Contractor Controlled Insurance Program
* **OCIP:** Owner Controlled Insurance Program
* Customer requires Desert Services to be on their insurance
* Usually in addition to Desert Services' own insurance
* Some programs deduct cost from contract amounts

* *Kendra's Responsibilities:**

1. **Setup:** Receive enrollment paperwork, complete forms, submit
2. **Certificates:** Coordinate with Dawn/Eva to get certs to customer
3. **Monthly Reporting:** Report hours worked on CSIP/OCIP jobs

    * Must log into various websites (each program different)
    * Enter hours worked per job per month
    * Even if zero hours: "You still have to go in there every month and just put zero"
    * Inspection-only jobs: Zero labor hours for months/years, still must report monthly
    * "Do you know how often we work on site right away in the beginning and then we might not actually work on site again for two years when it closes"
4. **Notifications:** Receives emails when reports late

    * "I get emails when they're late and that's when I get them in"

* *Volume:**

* Increasing: "A lot of companies now are requiring those"
* Similar to safety requirements: "All the companies now requiring all the safety stuff they didn't used to require"

* *Relief Coming:**

* New insurance company (starting Nov 1) may handle CSIP/OCIP themselves
* Kendra and Dawn "really really hoping" for this
* Will offload significant monthly burden

### Insurance Certificates

* *What It Is:**

* Proof of insurance required for most contract jobs
* Types: General Liability, Auto, Workers Comp
* Must be specific to job/customer

* *Process:**

1. Kendra or Dawn receives contract
2. Pulls insurance requirements from contract
3. Sends job info to insurance carriers (WorkComp and GL separate)
4. Carriers create certificate
5. Sends to customer
6. Tracks expiration, renews annually

* *Dawn's Role:**

* Primary handler with Eva assisting
* "A lot" of certificates
* Coordination especially heavy at insurance renewal (chaos in November)

* *Urgency:**

* Required before work can start (supposed to)
* Reality: "Get the contract late and then they start freaking out at us"
* Customer holds payments if certificates lapse
* "They start threatening and they won't pay us and they've been emailing us for over a month now constant non-stop"

### ADOT (Arizona Department of Transportation)

* *Kendra's Involvement:**

* Confirming payments
* Special paperwork requirements
* One of several "distractions" from core billing work
* Less detail provided in meetings, but noted as recurring responsibility

### Distractions from Core Billing

* *List of Interruptions:**

1. Contract signing and paperwork
2. Lien waivers for receiving payments
3. ADOT payment confirmations
4. Insurance certificate coordination
5. CSIP/OCIP monthly reporting
6. Textura/GC Pay/Procore payment processing
7. Customer questions and requests
8. "We need this right now" emails all day
9. QuickBooks access issues (remote desktop goes down frequently)
10. IT issues preventing access to QuickBooks

* *Impact:**

* "I never have a set schedule of any kind"
* "Just answer whatever is an urgent thing that day"
* Cannot work systematically through billing queues
* Billing gets done in rushed windows between interruptions
* End of month especially chaotic when platform billing windows open

## Systems & Tools

### QuickBooks

* *What It's Used For:**

* Customer/job database
* Estimate storage
* Contract storage (as attachments to jobs)
* Invoice creation and tracking
* Payment application
* Email approval storage (audit requirement)
* Communication notes (memo fields)
* Reporting (limited usefulness)

* *Structure:**

* **Customers:** Top level entities
* **Jobs:** Projects under each customer
* **Estimates:** Can be under Estimating Department (generic bids) or under specific customer

  * Moved from Estimating Department to Customer when job awarded
  * Matched to contract when received
  * Attached to customer, NOT to job (historical practice, not necessarily optimal)

* *Access:**

* Desktop version (not cloud)
* Must remote into office computers via screen connect
* Frequent connection problems: "My remote session didn't like that... very temperamental"
* Dawn's computer goes down frequently: "Eva has to restart my computer, I can't work without QuickBooks"
* Chi couldn't get access for weeks: "They're dragging their feet"

* *Limitations:**

* Not designed for construction contractors: "QuickBooks just is not really made for this kind of company, it's made for smaller companies"
* Cannot separate retention from actual receivables
* Receivables reports useless: "Can't print a receivables report... thousands of outstanding invoices"
* Month-end close prevents memo updates (audit requirement conflict)
* No subcontractor functionality (not needed but indicates wrong product tier)
* No construction-specific features (AIA integration, schedule of values, etc.)

* *Invoice Types/Numbering:**

* SWPPP invoices: Start with "SW"
* Water truck/sweeper invoices: Start with "A"
* Portajohn invoices: Start with "PJ"
* Rolloff invoices: "Just numbers" (from Crow)
* Allows some filtering but limited

* *Audit Requirements:**

* New requirement (since Tim's ownership, new accounting structure)
* All approvals must be documented in QuickBooks
* Emails, contracts, POs must be attached to jobs
* "Everyone should be doing that with like just any email or any PO or anything, throwing it into QuickBooks and attaching it just so we have something, some proof that the work was requested"
* Jayson: "A lot of this stuff is like new because of the way accounting is being done. Before it used to be we just got email proof that we were good, they didn't have to go into QuickBooks"

* *Problems:**

* Not accessible remotely without desktop connection
* Slow/unreliable remote access
* Data entry duplicated (QuickBooks + Excel + billing platforms)
* Cannot track what's really needed for construction business
* Month-end close creates billing information gaps

### Excel Spreadsheets

* *SWPPP Master Schedule** (Jayson):

* Tabs: Need to Schedule, Confirmed Schedule, Billed and Verified
* Tracks all SWPPP work from request through billing
* Color coded: Pink (scheduled), Green (done, ready to bill), White (billed)
* Kendra reviews for billing
* "All we've done since I've been here" - Kendra

* *SWPPP Task Tracker** (Jayson):

* Tracks SWPPP books/narratives in progress
* Status updates (waiting for NOI, waiting for plan, in progress, complete)
* Date tracking
* Moved to "complete" when done

* *Customer Rental Master** (Kendra):

* Tracks all rental equipment (temp fence, grates, backflows, water ramps, water donkeys, hoses)
* "How we've tracked our rental items for 17 years"
* Tabs: Active rentals, Billed and Verified
* Sort monthly, bill for another month, cut/paste to billed tab when done
* Problem: Quantities not tracked, must look up in QuickBooks each time
* Problem: Constant changes not updated (fence added/removed)

* *Problems:**

* No integration between spreadsheets and QuickBooks
* Same information in multiple places
* Must manually cross-reference
* Information only as current as last manual update
* Kendra: "Worst one" at Excel (even though uses daily)
* No inventory tracking capability
* No forecasting capability

### Billing Platforms

* *Textura** (Most Common):

* Setup: Company profile, customer adds jobs, email notification auto-sent
* Schedule of values creation
* Monthly billing submission
* Automatic retention calculation
* Lien waiver integration
* Payment processing

* *GC Pay:**

* Similar to Textura
* Company profile exists
* Customer adds jobs
* "Hundreds and hundreds of them a month" (email volume)

* *Procore:**

* Individual project invites
* Different setup from Textura/GC Pay
* Customer sends invite per project
* Otherwise similar functionality

* *Premier:**

* Newer platform
* "Only a handful of people use"
* "Terrible, very strange and doesn't work very well"

* *Sightline:**

* For manual AIA creation
* When customer doesn't use other platforms
* Replaced hand-written AIAs

* *Legacy (Historical):**

* Manual AIA forms filled out by hand
* "We always did by hand"
* Now digital platforms, much easier

* *Problems:**

* Multiple platforms to monitor
* Each works differently
* Email overload (hundreds per month)
* Customers slow to set up projects in platforms
* "Folders for each platform because I get hundreds and hundreds of them a month"

### SharePoint

* *Current Use:**

* Data drive for shared files
* SWPPP Plans folder (supposed to have all plans)
* Dust permits folder
* NOI folder
* SWPPP narrative templates
* Boilerplate documents
* Customer documents (scattered)

* *Problems:**

* SWPPP plans not consistently stored there
* Jared sometimes puts in Monday instead
* "Nobody uses Monday so Monday has to go into here because this is how Kendra and all of us find shit right now"
* No consistent folder structure per project
* Documents scattered
* "It would be nice if there was like some big database and like something that had all this stuff"

* *Ideal State (Per Jayson):**

* Centralized repository per project
* All project documents in one place: NOI, dust permit, SWPPP plan, contracts, estimates
* Accessible to everyone who needs it
* "So everybody can see it... one spot would be nice for that one project"

### Monday.com

* *Current Use (Limited):**

* Jared uses for some estimating workflow
* Sometimes SWPPP plans stored there
* Not accessible to operations team

* *Problems:**

* "Nobody uses Monday"
* Creates visibility gaps: "I don't know where he puts them [SWPPP plans]. I think he's putting them in Monday"
* Should be using SharePoint for universal access

### Crow

* *Current Use:**

* Rolloff tracking (Wendy)
* Portajohn tracking (Steven - new)
* Water meter tracking (Daniel's work)
* Job history and reactivation

* *Capabilities:**

* Customer/job database
* Service history by location
* Job reactivation (brings up all previous info)
* Notes and communication
* Billing integration

* *Not Used For (But Could Be):**

* SWPPP dispatching
* Water truck/sweeper scheduling
* Temp fence coordination

* *Why Not SWPPP:**

* "Never been built for SWPPP"
* More complex work order requirements
* Multiple line items per visit
* Variable quantities
* Need "McDonald's app" simplicity: "Like a hamburger, I want pickles lettuce and mayonnaise on it"
* Current Crow: "They just go to one thing and they say I'm here and then that's it"

* *Jayson's View:**

* Would work for water truck, sweeper, simple services
* Could help with real-time visibility: "If we had an app like Crow I can start seeing where they're at"
* Text updates when job done
* Fill schedule gaps from cancellations
* Better than printed work orders

* *Potential:**

* Service Titan might work better for SWPPP complexity
* Need customization for construction industry
* Job reactivation feature valuable: "All the information you need on it, it's already built in there"

### Compliance Pro App

* *What It Is:**

* Inspector app for SWPPP inspections
* Requires photos and descriptions
* Being adopted by Logan in Tucson (12-19 sites)
* Goal: All inspectors using by January 1

* *Benefits:**

* Forces documentation (pictures required)
* May require descriptions
* Better deficiency reporting
* "Should fix some of this because picture required and maybe adding a description is required"

* *Current Status:**

* Logan spearheading adoption
* James using for some sites
* Not fully deployed yet

## Communication Patterns & Challenges

### How Work Enters the System

* *Five Primary Channels:**

1. **Customer Contacts Director Directly**

    * Email, call, or text to Rick, Brandon, Lacey, Jayson, other delivery managers
    * For established relationships
    * Bypasses formal channels
    * Directors add to their own schedules (water truck, sweeper)
    * Or forward to Jayson for SWPPP work

2. **Customer Contacts General Line → Answering Service → Director**

    * Kelly (answering service) gets calls
    * Takes message, emails director
    * Common for rolloff, portajohn, some sweeper/water truck
    * Problem: No email confirmation, just phone notes
    * Audit risk: "For the audit purposes that can be a problem"

3. **Site Services Contacts Director**

    * Inspector finds deficiency, needs rework scheduled
    * Inspector contacts Jayson (or sales rep, or director)
    * Should include: pictures, quantities, location, super approval
    * Often incomplete information

4. **Customer Contacts in Response to Inspector**

    * Inspector writes up deficiency
    * Customer calls Desert Services for repair
    * Sometimes urgent (regulatory pressure)
    * May skip approval process: "Sometimes they don't even want pricing, they just want it fixed"

5. **Contract Received**

    * Email to contracts@desertservices (or individual)
    * Triggers contract review process
    * Should trigger precommunication but often doesn't

* *Problems:**

* Too many entry points
* No central tracking
* Information scattered across emails, phone messages, texts
* Jayson: "It's always an emergency, everything's always an emergency"
* No visibility into what's been requested until someone acts on it

### Internal Communication

* *Contract Distribution:**

* Sent to contracts email
* Everyone receives: estimating, operations, billing, inspections, signs
* Problem: "Now it just goes to everybody and if someone doesn't feel like reading the entire contract..."
* Results in: Wrong scope delivered, questions about basic details, 20+ email chains

* *Better Model (Jeff Gardner's Approach):**

* Reviewed contract
* Sent only to people involved
* Filtered by scope: "If there weren't inspections on it, it wouldn't go to the inspectors"
* Kendra: "Would just be helpful to have something like that again, there's just no time"

* *Current Issues:**

* Email overload
* Important details buried in threads
* Multiple people asking same questions
* Information silos (QuickBooks vs. SharePoint vs. email vs. Excel)

### Customer Communication

* *Precommunication (Should Happen, Often Doesn't):**

* Request NOI immediately upon contract
* Request dust permit
* Request SWPPP plan (or confirm they know we're creating it)
* Request site contact information
* Confirm installation details
* Discuss readiness and timing

* *Who Communicates:**

* Estimating (Jared) during bid process
* Operations (Jayson) for installation coordination
* Billing (Kendra) for contract issues and change orders
* Inspectors (James, Logan, Herve) for deficiencies
* Signs (Karen) for permit/NOI information
* Problem: "Three people calling about the sticker... should just be one"

* *Customer Confusion:**

* Don't understand NOI vs. NDC
* Don't know they need SWPPP plan
* Don't know what information Desert Services needs
* Don't understand readiness requirements
* Often unresponsive to questions

* *Ideal (Per Jayson):**

* Sales or project coordinator handles all precommunication
* Gathers all information upfront
* Provides complete package to operations
* Operations just schedules and executes
* "If we could go out and ask all those questions and then hand it to me I'd already have it all"

### Inspector Communication

* *Current State:**

* Inspectors visit sites, find deficiencies
* Write up in inspection report (emailed to customer)
* If major: Should communicate to Jayson with details
* Often incomplete: No pictures, no measurements, no super approval

* *What Should Happen:**

* Inspector finds deficiency
* Takes picture showing extent and location
* Measures quantity (or estimates using known dimensions like 12ft fence panels)
* Walks to job trailer, gets super approval in person (or emails with pictures)
* CCs Jayson on approval email
* Jayson has everything needed to schedule repair

* *Benefits:**

* Eliminates bottlenecks: "Then I'm not getting all the emails and stuff, but once they get the approval then I'm like oh I'll put it on schedule now"
* One person handles from start to finish
* Super not bothered multiple times
* Clear documentation for billing

* *Compliance Pro App Should Help:**

* Requires pictures
* May require descriptions
* Standardizes process

### Sales/Operations Handoff

* *Current Gap:**

* Sales (Jared) submits estimate
* Contract received (maybe to Jared, maybe not)
* Operations (Jayson) finds out about job... somehow
* Missing: Clear handoff with complete information

* *What Operations Needs:**

* Matched estimate and contract
* All discrepancies resolved
* Installation details confirmed
* Customer contact information
* Site access requirements
* NOI, dust permit, SWPPP plan (or plan for obtaining)
* Timing expectations

* *Current Reality:**

* "Sometimes he'll just send it to me and Jason if it doesn't match... there's not really any and all"
* Jayson receives email blasts about contracts with unresolved issues
* Must engage in 20+ email chain to resolve
* Wastes time: "I don't need to see those emails until all the negotiating is done"

## Process Issues & Opportunities

### Contract Management

* *Current Problems:**

1. **No Single Owner**

    * Jared supposed to match estimates to contracts
    * Sometimes does, sometimes doesn't
    * Kendra reviews and fixes issues
    * No clear responsibility

2. **Timing Issues**

    * Work starts before contract received (common)
    * Work starts before contract reviewed
    * Billing platforms not set up in time
    * Change orders needed for work already done

3. **Information Scatter**

    * Contracts only in QuickBooks (no SharePoint repository)
    * Can't access without QuickBooks login
    * Attached to customer, not clearly labeled
    * No contract log or tracking

4. **Matching Process**

    * Jared checks dollar amount
    * Kendra checks everything else
    * Duplicate effort
    * Still things fall through cracks

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Dedicated Contract Coordinator Role**

    * Reviews every contract upon receipt
    * Matches to estimate completely
    * Resolves discrepancies with customer
    * Confirms billing requirements
    * Extracts critical information (NOI requirements, insurance, etc.)
    * Creates standardized handoff package for operations
    * Coordinates with billing for schedule of values setup

2. **Contract Repository**

    * SharePoint folder structure by customer/job
    * All contracts, estimates, change orders in one place
    * Accessible without QuickBooks
    * Searchable and reportable

3. **Contract Checklist**

    * Standard review items
    * Sign-off before work authorized
    * Exception process for urgent starts
    * Tracks who reviewed, when, what issues found

### Precommunication

* *Current Problems:**

1. **No Ownership**

    * Everyone assumes someone else will ask for NOI, dust permit, etc
    * Result: No one asks, or multiple people ask

2. **Timing**

    * Happens ad-hoc during installation coordination (too late)
    * Should happen immediately upon contract receipt

3. **Incomplete**

    * Miss critical requirements
    * Discover gaps during installation (delays and inefficiency)

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Precommunication Checklist**

    * Triggered automatically when contract received
    * Assigned owner (project coordinator or sales)
    * Standard questions based on contract scope

      * NOI status and copy request
      * Dust permit status and copy request
      * SWPPP plan availability
      * Site contact and access details
      * Installation readiness questions
      * Special requirements (badging, PPE, parking, hours)

    * Completion required before scheduling

2. **Customer Portal or Form**

    * Send link with contract signature
    * Customer fills out requirements
    * Reduces phone tag
    * Creates documentation

3. **Integration with Scheduling**

    * Cannot schedule until precommunication complete
    * Flags in system for incomplete items

### Data Entry Duplication

* *Current Problems:**

* Same information entered in QuickBooks, Excel, work orders, billing platforms
* Jayson: "If there was a system that would make it go faster... this is duplicating it"
* Time-consuming and error-prone
* Information gets out of sync

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Single Source of Truth**

    * Enter once, appear everywhere needed
    * Project management system with integrations
    * Or better construction-specific accounting software

2. **Template Automation**

    * Work orders auto-generate from scheduling system
    * Pull information from project database
    * Reduce manual typing

3. **Mobile Data Capture**

    * Crews enter work completion on tablets/phones
    * Flows directly to billing
    * Eliminates handwritten work orders and re-entry

### Scheduling & Dispatch

* *Current Problems:**

1. **Manual & Time-Consuming**

    * Build schedules throughout day when interrupted constantly
    * Print work orders end of day (often late)
    * No real-time visibility

2. **Communication Gaps**

    * Email schedules not read
    * Cancellations not communicated
    * Cannot fill schedule gaps dynamically

3. **No Capacity Planning**

    * Don't know what's committed for future
    * Don't know if have enough crew/equipment
    * Last-minute scrambling

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Dispatching Software**

    * Crow for water truck, sweeper, simple services
    * Service Titan or similar for SWPPP
    * Real-time crew status
    * Mobile work order access
    * Automatic notifications

2. **Capacity Dashboard**

    * Shows committed work by day/week
    * Flags over-capacity situations
    * Helps with quoting and promising dates

3. **Automated Schedule Building**

    * Route optimization
    * Crew skill matching
    * Equipment availability checking

### Inventory & Asset Tracking

* *Current Problems:**

1. **No Tracking**

    * Don't know how much temp fence available
    * Don't know how much fence deployed
    * Don't know rental equipment quantities on sites

    * Don't track condition or damage
    * Unknown tax implications

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Inventory System**

    * Track fence panels, grates, backflows, etc

### Billing & Change Orders

* *Current Problems:**

1. **Reactive Change Orders**

    * Discovered at billing time (too late)
    * Customers unresponsive
    * Kendra has no time to follow up
    * Change orders sit for months

2. **No Project Management**

    * No one owns project from start to finish
    * No one proactively managing scope changes
    * Billing discovers problems, can't fix them

3. **Platform Delays**

    * Customers don't set up billing access for months
    * Cannot bill for work completed
    * Cash flow impact

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Project Manager/Coordinator Role**

    * Owns project from award through closeout
    * Monitors scope vs. contract
    * Requests change orders proactively
    * Follows up with customer
    * Coordinates with billing
    * Industry standard: "That's normally how it works... every company that talks to me is like 'so how come?'"

2. **Change Order Workflow**

    * Operations flags scope change when it happens
    * PM reviews and confirms
    * PM requests customer approval before work (when possible)
    * If emergency work, PM requests approval immediately after
    * PM follows up until approved
    * Updates billing with approved change order
    * Billing updates schedule of values and bills

3. **Customer Portal**

    * Self-service change order requests

### Inspector Communication & Deficiency Management

* *Current Problems:**

1. **Incomplete Deficiency Reports**

    * No pictures or measurements
    * Superintendent not involved in communication
    * Jayson must call around to get details

2. **Multiple Touchpoints**

    * Inspector finds issue
    * Tells customer
    * Customer calls Jayson
    * Jayson calls inspector for details
    * Jayson calls customer for approval
    * "Three people not getting involved... one person that gets a call could just take care of it all"

* *Opportunities:**

1. **Inspector-Owned Process**

    * Find deficiency
    * Document with pictures and measurements
    * Get super approval on-site (walk to trailer)
    * Email Jayson with approval already obtained
    * Jayson just schedules repair
    * One person, complete loop

2. **Compliance Pro App Deployment**

    * Accelerate rollout (target: Jan 1)
    * Train all inspectors
    * Enforce picture requirements
    * Build templates for common deficiencies

3. **Deficiency Dashboard**

    * Track open deficiencies by project
    * Age analysis (how long since reported)
    * Assignment and status
