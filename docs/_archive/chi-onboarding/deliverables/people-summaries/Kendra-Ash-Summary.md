## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kendra Ash is the central figure in Desert Services' billing, contract management, and accounts receivable operations. With 17+ years at the company, she manages all SWPPP and temp fence billing, contract review and execution, rental equipment tracking, payment processing across multiple platforms (Textura, Procore, GC Pay, Premier), insurance certificate coordination, and change order management. She is the only person who signs contracts and manages contract true-ups. Kendra serves as institutional memory for the company, having worked through the transition from Mike Lane's ownership to Tim's current management.

## BILLING PROCESSES & WORKFLOWS

### Contract vs. Invoice Billing

* *Contract Billing (More Complex):**

- Percentage breakdown by service

  - SWPPP: 50%+ contract
  - Water Truck/Sweeper: 25-30% contract
  - Roll-offs/Porta-Johns: 90% invoice

- Can only submit once per month
- Must wait for customer's billing window to open (typically 10th-25th of month)
- Submitted through platforms: Textura, GC Pay, Procore, Premier, or manual AIA
- Subject to 10% retention (sometimes 5% or other percentages)
- Retention can change during project lifecycle
- Requires schedule of values setup

* *Invoice Billing (Simpler):**

- "Really easy and we wish everything was by invoice"
- Create invoice and send immediately
- No monthly waiting period
- No retention typically
- Faster payment

* *Billing Cycle Reality:**

- Most services now billed monthly regardless of contract vs. invoice
- Billing windows vary by customer (10th to 25th of month)
- Work completed throughout month goes on next available billing submission
- Memo field tracks submission date in format: "Submit in Textura 10/8"

### Jason's Excel Schedule Management

* *Confirmed Schedule Workflow:**

1. Work completed in field
2. Jason updates "Work Description" in column K
3. Green highlighting removed when work complete added
4. Kendra reviews non-colored rows (no green/pink = needs billing)
5. Yellow = questions/issues to resolve
6. Kendra creates invoice or adds to contract billing
7. Kendra moves to "Billed and Verified" section after billing complete

* *Information Kendra Extracts:**

- Work description details
- Hours/quantities/materials
- Special requirements (certified payroll, etc.)
- Pricing verification against estimate

* *Common Issues Kendra Discovers:**

- Work done not on contract (requires change order)
- Work on contract not completed
- Quantities exceed contract amounts (requires change order)
- Missing inspections from inspector schedules
- Pricing discrepancies
- Signs not delivered when they should be
- Rock entrances installed when not in contract

## RENTAL EQUIPMENT TRACKING

### Rental Master Spreadsheet

* *Location:** Data drive → Customer Rental Master

* *Items Tracked:**

- Temp fence (no quantities tracked in spreadsheet - changes too frequently)
- Grates
- Backflows
- Hoses ("always shot when they're done" - Kendra hates renting these)
- Water ramps (protect hoses crossing roads)
- Water donkeys (related to meter/backflow hookups)

* *Process:**

1. Work completed notification from field
2. Enter customer and item information
3. Bill through date updated monthly
4. Sort by bill through date
5. Generate monthly rental invoices
6. Cut and paste completed rentals to "Billed and Verified" tab

* *Limitations:**

- No quantity tracking for temp fence (changes too often with adds/removes)
- Must check each invoice in QuickBooks to see quantities at specific time
- No asset tracking (don't know total temp fence inventory)
- Damaged equipment tracked on invoices but not in master system
- No depreciation or tax tracking

* *Historical Context:**

- Used this system for 17 years
- Last full count was during Tim's company acquisition
- Don and Kendra totaled everything for sale
- Tim has purchased more fence since then - no updated count
- Mike Lane ran company "very, very different" - all cash basis, no formal tracking

- --

## PAYMENT PLATFORMS & SYSTEMS

### Platform Overview

* *Textura (Most Common for SWPPP):**

- Company-wide login
- Automatic email when new job added
- Kendra sets up schedule of values
- 95% of customers set up their own project; Kendra sets up billing
- Exception: Ryan Companies sets up schedule of values for them
- "Getting an email notification every time a job's set up"

* *GC Pay:**

- Company-wide login
- Customer adds Desert Services to project
- Kendra receives automatic access

* *Procore:**

- Sends individual invites per project
- Must accept invite for each job
- Some customers use for payments, others just for documents

* *Premier:**

- "Terrible" platform
- "Only a handful of people use"
- "Doesn't work very well"
- Company-wide login similar to Textura/GC Pay

* *Manual AIA (Sightline Platform):**

- For customers requiring old-school AIA format
- Kendra sets up manually
- Used when customer doesn't use one of the four main platforms

### Platform Access & Setup

* *Customer Responsibilities:**

- Notify what platform they use (listed in contract)
- Add Desert Services to their project
- Provide access credentials
- Set billing windows

* *Kendra's Responsibilities:**

- Monitor for new project notifications
- Set up schedule of values
- Submit monthly billings within windows
- Track submission dates in QuickBooks memo field
- Chase down access when not provided

* *Common Problem:**

- Jobs start in December
- Contract received July
- Still not set up in Textura by October
- Cannot bill until customer sets up access
- Kendra emails repeatedly requesting setup
- "I just emailed them again during billing time... this month they just didn't even respond"
- No one has time to persistently follow up

- --

## CONTRACT INTAKE & MANAGEMENT PROCESS

### Contract Receipt

* *Who Receives Contracts:**

- Jared (primary - sends out estimates)
- Kendra (listed on e-docs)
- Jason
- Directors (occasionally)
- Don, Karen (rarely)
- Rick, Lacey, Brandon (sales team)
- Can come via email, phone call, or direct contact

* *Ideal vs. Reality:**

- Ideal: Receive contract before work starts
- Reality: "We're on site before we ever get a contract and know exactly how we're billing or what requirements they have"
- Reason: "Everybody like I'm sure we already know everybody needs us on site first before they can do anything else"

### Contract Review Process (Kendra's Steps)

* *Step 1: Jared's Initial Review**

- Supposed to match estimate to contract
- Verify dollar amount matches
- Send to contracts@ email with estimate attached
- Reality: "Normally I just take care of it now because... I'm the one who has to sign the contracts"

* *Step 2: Kendra's Comprehensive Review**

- Verify estimate dollar amount matches contract
- Check all line items match
- Identify items in contract not in estimate
- Identify items in estimate not in contract
- Verify job naming matches (often different between estimate and contract)
- Check billing requirements (Textura vs. GC Pay vs. invoice, etc.)
- Review insurance requirements
- Check retention percentage

* *Step 3: Contract Corrections**

- Send back to customer for changes "pretty much all the time"
- "That's one of the more time consuming things"
- Problem: "Customers don't answer very often"
- Exception: "Unless of course they want the job started immediately"
- If already installed: "Then it's really difficult to get because they don't really care"

* *Step 4: Job Setup**

- Job name created in QuickBooks
- Contract and estimate attached to customer in QuickBooks
- Estimate moved from "Estimating Department" to specific customer
- All communication attached to QuickBooks for audit purposes

* *Step 5: Contract Signature**

- Kendra is only person who signs contracts
- After all corrections finalized
- Signed contract returned to customer

* *Step 6: Contract Distribution**

- Sent to contracts@ email (everyone on distribution list)
- Operations reviews attached estimate to see involvement
- Triggers

  - Signs (Karen)
  - NOI requests (Jason or Karen)
  - Dust permits (Jason, Jared, Karen)
  - Insurance certs (Don and Eva)
  - Inspections (inspector assignment)
  - Installations (Jason)

### Contract vs. Estimate Naming Problem

* *Issue:**

- Estimate named based on plan drawings
- Contract names job something completely different
- Email communications use third name
- "No one has any idea what anyone's talking about because they're all different"
- "We don't even know they're the same job"

* *Impact:**

- Multiple people working on "different" jobs that are actually same
- Communication breakdowns
- Duplicate work
- Missing work

* *Historical Solution:**

- Jeff Gardner used to handle contract coordination
- Would send contract only to relevant people
- Would verify naming and communicate job name
- Now goes to everyone, nobody coordinates naming

* *Current Gap:**

- "There's just no time. There's just no one with time"
- Need dedicated contract coordinator role

## ESTIMATING & QUICKBOOKS STRUCTURE

### Estimate Storage in QuickBooks

* *Two Locations:**

* *1. Estimating Department:**

- Used when customer not yet determined
- Common for bidding situations
- Example: City of Scottsdale sends to 20 general contractors bidding
- Estimate goes to all 20, stored under "Estimating Department"
- Moved to specific customer when job awarded

* *2. Under Specific Customer:**

- When specific customer requests estimate
- Stored under customer name
- Memo field contains job name (when labeled correctly)
- Challenge: Jobs get "so many different names"

### QuickBooks Challenges

* *System Limitations:**

- "QuickBooks is totally separate. You have to be able to get onto the whatever the server at the office to be able to get into QuickBooks"
- Not designed for company this size: "QuickBooks is made for small... companies"
- Cannot print receivables report due to retention
- No way to differentiate retention vs. past due in system
- Locking periods required for accounting creates billing challenges

* *Remote Access Issues:**

- Must remote into office desktop to access QuickBooks
- "My remote con session... is very temperamental"
- Gets kicked out frequently
- Eva must restart computer from office
- "I usually just start a lot earlier, but... Eva got in at seven... she restarted my computer for me"
- Cannot work without QuickBooks access

* *Memo Field Problem:**

- Historically used memo field for all communication tracking
- Tracked submission dates, payment status, issues
- "That's how Karen Don and I always just communicated with all of our billing"
- Now periods must be locked for accounting
- Once locked, cannot update memo
- "Now we don't know what's been built where when"

* *Retention Tracking Nightmare:**

- Thousands of outstanding invoices showing as unpaid
- Actually retention, not past due
- Cannot run standard receivables report
- No formula to differentiate (retention varies: 10%, 5%, 7.5%, 1%, changes mid-project)
- "Don could possibly figure it out... through Excel spreadsheets"
- Manual tracking only option

- --

## CHANGE ORDER MANAGEMENT

### When Change Orders Needed

* *Discovered During Billing:**

1. Work completed exceeds contract amount
2. Work completed not on contract at all
3. Contract items not completed
4. Pricing discrepancies

* *Problem:**

- Kendra discovers issues only during monthly billing cycle
- "To me it's always a surprise"
- "I have no idea what we're doing until I go to bill for it"
- Should know in advance before work performed

* *Impact:**

- "I go to bill for it, I realize it's something brand new that was never even in the contract"
- Cannot submit billing until change order processed
- "When I go to bill that month and oh shit I can't because this wasn't even on the contract"

### Change Order Process

* *Current Reality:**

- No project manager role to track scope changes
- Directors perform work without change order approval
- Kendra identifies issue during billing
- Kendra requests change order
- Kendra follows up (only once per month when billing)
- Customers frequently ignore requests
- "Then they might just ignore me for another four months"
- "Sitting there for... that happens all the time. It's very, very often"

* *What Should Happen:**

- Change order request before work performed
- "Really in the... we really should be getting the change order before we even do it"
- Project manager would track and request change orders
- Approval before field execution

* *Industry Standard:**

- Project managers typically handle change orders
- "They usually do do the change order... they have... someone they'll ask someone to get the change order request ready for them but then they follow through with it"

- --

## INSURANCE & COMPLIANCE

### Certificate of Insurance (COI)

* *Standard Requirements:**

- Work comp
- General liability
- Auto insurance
- Required for most contract jobs
- Some small jobs accept "any and all" cert

* *Process:**

- Don and Eva pull information from contract
- Send to WorkComp company
- Send to GL company
- Companies send certs back
- Don distributes to customers
- "Don has been taking care of that... Now she has Eva helping her 'cause there's a lot"

### CSIP & OCIP Programs

* *What They Are:**

- CSIP: Certified/Controlled Insurance Program
- OCIP: Owner Certified Insurance Program
- Owner requires subcontractors to be part of their insurance
- "Because... customers can't trust their subs to keep insurance"

* *Financial Impact:**

- Desert Services pays double insurance
- Own insurance plus customer's program
- Some customers pay for it
- Some customers deduct from contract amounts

* *Monthly Reporting Requirements:**

- Must report hours worked on site
- Every month for every CSIP/OCIP job
- Even when zero hours: "You still have to go in there every month and just put Zero"
- "I wish you could just do all of those at one time, but you can't"
- Multiple different websites, all different platforms
- Late notifications trigger Kendra to update

* *Administrative Burden:**

- Initial setup paperwork
- Monthly hour reporting
- Multiple websites to track
- Work may happen in month 1, then nothing for 2 years (just inspections)
- Still must report zero hours monthly for entire 2 years

* *Hope for Improvement:**

- New insurance company starting November 1st
- "Actually does CSIP stuff themselves and... OCIP stuff themselves"
- "Don and I are really, really hoping that once that happens... they'll be able to help us out with those a lot more"

### Insurance Certificate Renewals

* *Annual Renewal Crisis:**

- Insurance renews November 1st
- All customers need updated certificates
- Must send to every active customer
- Customers threaten to kick off sites if not received
- "Otherwise we get kicked off of all of our sites"
- "They won't pay us"
- "Been emailing us for over a month now constant non-stop"
- "We're delinquent already which we're not but they just start sending out warnings"
- Natalie (new insurance contact) handling transition

- --

## CUSTOMER & PROJECT MANAGEMENT

### Best Customer Example: MT Builders

* *Why They're "Amazing":**

- Always send contract
- Always use Textura for SWPPP
- Everything else they allow invoicing
- Consistent across every single job
- "Billing department makes the rules, not the project manager"
- "That's the one customer. Everyone should run like MT builders"

### Common Customer Challenges

* *Contract Setup Delays:**

- Example: Legacy North Apartments & Townhomes

  - Started work December of last year
  - Contract received July
  - Still not set up in Textura by October
  - "This happens too... for to go this long is a little bit uncommon, but it's happened several times in my life"
  - Cannot bill any contract work until Textura access
  - Kendra emails monthly requesting setup
  - Customers don't respond

* *Retention Changes Mid-Project:**

- Start at 10% retention
- Can drop to 5%
- Can drop to 1%
- Can release some but not all
- "They can change during the project"
- "Wouldn't have known that ahead of time"
- Find out when billing gets rejected
- Must redo billing with new retention percentage

* *Billing Rejections:**

- Submit pay app through platform
- Customer rejects
- Kendra receives email explaining why
- Must correct and resubmit
- Common reasons

  - Retention percentage changed
  - Item not approved for this billing cycle
  - Compliance hold (missing insurance cert)
  - Lean waiver signature required

### Example: Textura Email Types

* *Common Notifications:**

- "Complete invoicing" reminders
- Kicked out/rejected billing
- Compliance on hold (missing insurance)
- Lien waiver signature required
- "Not included in the draw this month"
- Payment processed notifications

* *Volume:**

- "I get hundreds and hundreds of them a month"
- Separate email folder just for Textura
- "I have it all go to a separate folder"
- Sorts through to find actionable items vs. notifications

- --

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### 1. Lack of Project Management Structure

* *Current State:**

- "Well, so how come 'cause I'm the only one... every once in a while if Don or Karen have... their work on a change order... they'll follow up on it... if there's anything different or wrong I'm the one who must take care of all of it"
- No one tracking project scope changes
- No one managing customer communications proactively
- No one coordinating services across divisions
- Kendra discovers all issues during billing cycle

* *What Industry Standard Looks Like:**

- Project coordinators assigned to jobs
- Track billing for their assigned projects
- Handle change orders proactively
- Manage customer communications
- "Like by yourself is like how it goes. You have like project coordinators who each have so many jobs. They don't have all of this and all of this"
- "You somebody has to manage all the bodies and the schedules. But then yeah for them it's running"

* *Impact:**

- Everything reactive instead of proactive
- Customer relationship challenges
- Payment delays
- Cannot forecast or plan
- Cannot grow efficiently

### 2. Contract Processing Bottleneck

* *Volume vs. Capacity:**

- "Can get ten contracts in a week"
- "Just recently it seems like we just haven't been getting that many"
- Must review every contract personally
- Must sign every contract personally
- Must handle all corrections and negotiations
- Also doing daily billing, payments, rentals, insurance, change orders

* *Time Consuming Elements:**

- Reading entire contract (Kendra hates reading them)
- Comparing to estimate
- Identifying discrepancies
- Negotiating changes with customer
- "Back and forth" can take weeks or months
- "Getting changes on it Then it's really difficult to get because they don't really care"

* *Should Happen vs. Reality:**

- Should have dedicated contract person (like Jeff Gardner used to do)
- Jeff would review, route only to relevant people, handle naming coordination
- "Now it just goes to everybody and if someone doesn't feel like reading the entire contract... then People don't know and we are doing the wrong thing"

### 3. QuickBooks Limitations

* *Not Designed for This Business:**

- "QuickBooks just is not really made for this kind of company. It's made for smaller... companies"
- Cannot track retention properly
- Cannot run receivables reports
- Cannot differentiate past due vs. retention
- Locking periods prevents communication tracking
- No integration with payment platforms

* *What Contractors Use:**

- Kendra doesn't know
- "I've talked to our contractors. Yeah And asked them before, but they use contract stuff"
- Need construction-specific software
- Would need to find other subcontractors to ask

* *Workarounds:**

- Manual Excel tracking (Don could create)
- Duplicate entry across systems
- Memory and email folder organization
- Invoice numbering conventions (SW-, A-, PJ-, etc.)

### 4. Remote Work Technology Issues

* *Remote Desktop Problems:**

- "My remote con session... is very temperamental and thinks I'm looking at bad things on the internet apparently"
- Gets kicked out regularly
- "Even this morning I couldn't get on until... Eva got in at seven... and she restarted my computer"
- "I have to have that happen all the time because I can't work without QuickBooks"

* *Why Remote Required:**

- QuickBooks only accessible via office desktop
- Cannot use online/cloud version
- Security implemented after company got hacked
- Screen Connect remote access setup

* *Impact:**

- Cannot start work until office staff arrive to restart
- Usually starts earlier to compensate
- Interruptions throughout day
- Cannot efficiently work from home

### 5. Work Forecasting & Equipment Tracking

* *No Visibility Into:**

- How much temp fence is currently out
- How much temp fence is owned
- When projects are ending
- When equipment will return
- Future capacity needs
- Material purchases needed

* *Example Questions No One Can Answer:**

- "How much temp fence do we have right now? How much temp fence do we own?" → "Oh gosh... No... a lot"
- "In three months are you gonna have like ten thousand... Temp fence grates?" → Don trying to start asking: "When are these jobs ending?"
- "What needs to happen going forward" for tax/depreciation tracking

* *Why It Matters:**

- Cannot forecast revenue
- Cannot plan equipment purchases
- Cannot optimize inventory
- Tax and depreciation unknown
- "I don't even know anything by the way, but... is that a thing?... taxes and depreciation or something"

### 6. Constant Interruptions & Urgent Requests

* *Daily Reality:**

- "Normally I don't have a set schedule of any kind... actually I don't I never do"
- "Whatever is an urgent thing that day"
- "Get emails all day long of we need this right now. We need this right now. We need this right now"
- Must stop billing to handle

  - Contract signatures
  - CSIP/OCIP paperwork
  - Lien waivers
  - Payment confirmations
  - ADOT paperwork
  - Customer emergencies

* *Impact on Billing:**

- "Billing, you only have a few days when you get the notice"
- "I do hundreds and hundreds of... contract billings a month"
- Constant context switching
- Cannot focus on billing cycle
- Work backs up

### 7. Multiple Entry Points & Communication Chaos

* *Who Can Be Contacted:**

- Sales team
- Directors
- Jason
- Jared
- Kendra
- Don
- Karen
- Delivery managers

* *Problem:**

- "Now we have many so it can go out to the people in the field... they can tell anybody"
- "Definitely something that needs to be tracked better now... just knowing that yes we are even getting the job to begin with"
- "Would be good if someone could follow up... and be that person or something"
- No centralized intake
- No tracking who was contacted
- Work can slip through cracks

* *Email Confirmation Gap:**

- Kelly (sweeping) and Wendy (roll-offs) take phone calls
- Don't send email confirmations
- "We don't always have them on street sweeping roll offs porta johns Sometimes water truck"
- Risk for audits
- "Now we need them because of audits"
- "I don't care. They still want proof"

## SYSTEMS & TOOLS

### QuickBooks (Primary Billing System)

* *Usage:**

- All invoicing
- Contract storage
- Payment tracking
- Estimate storage
- Customer records
- All attachments (contracts, emails, POs)

* *Invoice Numbering:**

- SW- prefix: SWPPP invoices
- A- prefix: Water truck and sweeper invoices
- PJ- prefix: Porta-John invoices
- Numbers only: Roll-offs (from CRO system)

* *Memo Field:**

- Tracks submission dates
- Tracks payment status
- Tracks issues and communications
- Critical for team communication
- Now being locked, creating problems

### Rental Master (Excel Spreadsheet)

- Active rentals
- Billed and Verified (historical)

* *Process:**

- Enter customer, item, dates
- Update "Bill Through Date" monthly
- Sort and generate invoices
- Cut and paste to Billed and Verified tab
- Repeat monthly

* *Used for 17 years - no changes**

### Jason's Excel Schedules

* *Confirmed Schedule:**

- All SWPPP work
- Pink = scheduled but not complete
- Green = completed but not billed
- No color = work completed info added, needs billing
- Yellow = questions/issues
- Kendra reviews daily during billing cycles
- Moves to "Billed and Verified" after invoice created

* *Information Density:**

- Job name
- Customer
- Date scheduled
- Date completed
- Work description
- Special notes (certified payroll, etc.)
- Materials used
- Hours worked

### Payment Platforms (Multiple Systems)

* *Textura:**

- Primary for SWPPP contract billing
- Hundreds of emails per month
- Separate email folder
- Must set up schedule of values
- Monthly billing windows

* *GC Pay, Procore, Premier:**

- Secondary platforms
- Each has different interface
- Each has different notification system
- Kendra manages all

* *Sightline:**

- Manual AIA platform
- For customers not using big four
- Kendra sets up manually

### Remote Access

* *Screen Connect:**

- Remote desktop software
- Temperamental
- Security implemented after hack
- Requires office staff for restart

## INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE

### Historical Context: Mike Lane Ownership

* *Business Model:**

- Previous owner Mike Lane
- Focused on remodeling business
- "Kendra effectively ran Desert Services" (per Daniel Vargas notes)
- Cash-basis accounting
- Very different operation style

* *Accounting Differences:**

- "Mike... did everything by cash"
- Never locked QuickBooks periods
- Only did one reconciliation per year (January)
- Would ask about February issues in January: "I don't freaking know"
- No formal tracking requirements
- No audits
- No depreciation tracking
- Kendra had more autonomy

* *Transition to Tim:**

- New ownership brought new requirements
- Must lock periods monthly
- Must have audits
- Formal reconciliations
- Everything "all new since Tim came on"
- Don wasn't always there - someone else briefly
- Mr. Don joined May - in middle of audit cleanup
- "Truly, we're all behind, you know?"

### Company Growth & Change

* *Personnel Changes:**

- Used to be 5 people in office
- Now many more
- Directors are new (site services people)
- Steven is new (porta-johns/roll-offs)
- Structure still evolving

* *Process Evolution:**

- Jeff Gardner used to coordinate contracts
- Would send only to relevant people
- Would check descriptions and matching
- That role eliminated - Kendra absorbed
- "But now I pretty much do"

* *What's Not Changed:**

- Rental tracking method (17 years same)
- QuickBooks as primary system
- Manual Excel schedules
- Kendra as central coordinator

## WATER METER & BACKFLOW PROCESS

### When Water Meters Needed

* *Trigger:**

- Construction site needs water access
- For filling water trucks
- For dust control
- For site operations

* *City Responsibilities Vary:**

- Some cities provide backflow
- Some cities provide certification
- Some require private contractor
- No consistent matrix exists

* *Spreadsheet Reference:**

- Customer Rental Master folder
- Lists different cities and requirements
- Example: City of Phoenix - $650, we provide backflow
- Example: City of Surprise - $600 (city portion) or $1,100 (Epcor portion)
- "We don't have anything. You know?" beyond basic spreadsheet

### Process & Challenges

* *Complexity:**

- Karen handles most water meter coordination
- Customers often don't know if meter is private or city
- Private meters require special paperwork from private owner
- Takes at least a week to get meter approved
- Multiple steps and city coordination
- Certification required before use (Brian's company does certifications)

* *Profitability Issues:**

- Don't make much money on meters
- "We don't really like to do meters"
- "It is... a lot of work because they don't know anything about them"
- Customers will have Desert Services do all work then pull permit themselves
- "They'll just pull it ourselves after we do it"
- Should charge more than $500 fee
- Tim agreed not to push this service

* *Ongoing Maintenance:**

- Meters expire annually
- Should proactively contact customers to renew
- Currently reactive - customer calls when expired
- "A lot of them think that it should have been our responsibility to track in the first place"
- Jared may have system in place but too new to have full year cycle
- Could be tracked in calendar with reminders

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. Project Management Structure

* *What's Needed:**

- Project managers or coordinators assigned to jobs
- Track scope, billing, changes for their projects
- Proactive change order management
- Single point of contact per project
- "It is like... at the at the end of the day it it is like a you need like a manager of those people and those sections"

* *Benefits:**

- Proactive vs. reactive management
- Better customer relationships
- Faster change order processing
- Forecasting ability
- Scalability for growth

### 2. Centralized Work Intake

* *Current Problem:**

- Multiple entry points
- No tracking of who was contacted
- No central record
- Work can slip through cracks

* *Potential Solutions:**

- Central intake person or system
- "Would be good if someone could follow up and after that and be that person or something"
- Track all incoming requests
- Route to appropriate person
- Maintain audit trail

### 3. Email Confirmation Requirement

* *Issue:**

- Kelly and Wendy take phone calls without email backup
- "We should have it. Something I don't just something something... just give me an email"
- Needed for audits
- Needed for payment protection

* *Implementation:**

- Enforce email confirmation policy
- "Everyone needs... to send everything in emails"
- Even phone calls must be followed with email
- Audit requirement makes this critical

### 4. Contract Coordination Role

* *Historical Model (Jeff Gardner):**

- Reviewed contracts centrally
- Checked estimate matching
- Verified descriptions align
- Sent only to relevant people
- Coordinated job naming
- "Jeff Gardner used to take care of that"

* *Current Gap:**

- "There's just no time. There's just no one with time"
- Kendra does some but also doing everything else
- Work quality suffering

* *Opportunity:**

- Reinstate dedicated contract coordinator
- Review and route contracts
- Verify estimate alignment
- Coordinate job naming across systems
- Handle initial customer negotiations

### 5. Better Software for Construction

* *QuickBooks Inadequate:**

- "QuickBooks just is not really made for this kind of company"
- Cannot handle retention properly
- Cannot integrate with payment platforms
- No project tracking
- Locking creates communication problems

* *Research Needed:**

- Talk to other subcontractors
- Find construction-specific software
- Must handle retention
- Must integrate with Textura/Procore/etc
- Must allow project tracking
- Must support remote work

### 6. Equipment & Asset Tracking

* *Current State:**

- No idea how much temp fence exists
- No tracking of damaged equipment
- No depreciation tracking
- No tax implications understood
- Last count was Tim's acquisition

* *What's Needed:**

- Asset management system
- Track quantities by type
- Track condition/damages
- Track location (which job)
- Forecast availability
- Tax/depreciation proper tracking
- "I've always... I was like, don't you need to know or want to track... how many... grates you you have and your fence"

### 7. Proactive Meter Renewal

* *Current:**

- Reactive - wait for customer to call
- Customer upset Desert Services didn't remind
- "A lot of them think that it should have been our responsibility to track"

* *Should Be:**

- Track expiration dates
- Proactive outreach before expiration
- Upsell opportunity
- Better customer service
- "That means set to be something that we do do"
- Calendar reminder system
- Jared may be setting this up

### 8. Dust Permit Proactive Sales

* *Opportunity Identified:**

- Can see all dust permits pulled
- Could proactively contact for services
- "Whenever there's a last inspection... somebody... we could be doing the cleaning"
- James has been doing this for SWPPP finals
- Could systematize across all permits

* *Implementation:**

- Monitor dust permit issuances
- Track expiration dates
- Proactive outreach for renewals
- Proactive outreach for related services
- Systematic vs. ad-hoc approach

## INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS

### Jared (Estimating)

* *Primary Interactions:**

- Receives contracts (as estimator)
- Supposed to match estimate to contract
- Supposed to verify dollar amounts
- Creates estimates in QuickBooks
- Pulls SWPPP plans
- Coordinates dust permits

* *Communication:**

- Kendra receives contracts from or via Jared
- Should coordinate when estimate doesn't match
- Reality: often Kendra just handles corrections herself
- "Normally I just take care of it now because... I'm the one who has to sign the contracts"

### Jason (SWPPP Operations)

* *Daily Interactions:**

- Manages SWPPP schedule (confirmed schedule Excel)
- Updates work completed information
- Kendra bills from his schedule
- Requests NOIs and dust permits
- Handles installations and field work

* *Information Flow:**

- Jason needs estimate/contract to know what to schedule
- "Otherwise Jason has no idea what they're scheduling"
- Superintendent doesn't always know what was awarded
- Kendra provides contract details to Jason
- Jason provides work complete details to Kendra

### Don (Accounting/AR)

* *Collaboration:**

- Receives checks and some electronic payments
- Kendra receives platform payments (Textura, Procore, etc.)
- Both handle payment application
- Don helps with CSIP/OCIP when she has time
- Don creates financial analyses
- Don manages collections

* *Overlap:**

- Both sign lien waivers
- Both process payments
- Both handle ADOT confirmations
- Could potentially track retention via Excel (Don's skillset)

### Eva (Administrative Support)

* *Support Provided:**

- Helps with insurance certificates
- Restarts Kendra's computer when remote access fails
- Assists with CSIP/OCIP paperwork
- Growing role in billing support

* *Critical Dependency:**

- Kendra cannot work when remote desktop fails
- Must wait for Eva to arrive at office
- "Eva got in at seven... she restarted my computer for me"

### Karen (Signs, Dust Permits, Backflow)

* *Coordination:**

- Karen needs NOI information for signs
- Kendra forwards NOI documents
- Karen handles water meter coordination
- Karen orders signs and dust permits
- Occasional change order follow-up support
- Sometimes receives contracts (rarely)

### Directors (Daniel, Kelly, Steven, Wendy)

* *Communication:**

- Can receive work requests directly from customers
- Should provide work complete information for billing
- Daniel (water trucks) - Miss Don helps ensure he sees emails
- Kelly (sweeping) - takes phone calls, doesn't always email
- Steven (porta-johns/roll-offs) - new, using CRO system
- Wendy (roll-offs backup) - takes phone calls without email confirmation

* *Challenges:**

- Multiple entry points for work
- Not all provide email confirmations
- Different systems (CRO vs. Jason's schedule vs. phone calls)
- Kendra must pull information from various sources

### Sales Team (Rick, Lacey, Brandon)

* *Involvement:**

- Sometimes receive contract notifications
- Growing sales role
- Can initiate work requests
- One-stop-shop approach for customers
- Website generates 1-2 requests per day

- --

## BILLING DETAILS & NUANCES

### Schedule of Values Creation

* *Purpose:**

- Break down contract into line items
- Set billing amounts per item
- Required for monthly contract billing
- Customer must approve before billing can start

* *Process:**

1. Review contract line items
2. Review estimate quantities and prices
3. Create schedule matching contract
4. Input into Textura/Procore/GC Pay/Premier
5. Submit to customer for approval
6. Customer approves schedule
7. Can begin monthly billing

* *Challenges:**

- Time-consuming to set up
- Must match contract exactly
- Different pricing for same items on different jobs

  - "Stock might be 245 for one job, but it's two seventy-five for one"
  - "Mobes are all different"
  - "There's a lot of different pricing for everything"

- Must look at "estimates and contracts all the time, over and over and over and over"

### Monthly Contract Billing Process

* *Typical Flow:**

1. Work completed throughout month
2. Billing window opens (typically 20th-25th)
3. Kendra reviews confirmed schedule for completed work
4. Verifies against schedule of values
5. Creates invoice in QuickBooks with memo "Not Submit"
6. Adds additional work to same invoice throughout month
7. When billing window opens, submits pay app through platform
8. Updates QuickBooks memo with submission date and platform
9. Platform processes and either approves or rejects
10. If rejected, fix issues and resubmit
11. If approved, wait for payment (typically 60 days)
12. Apply payment when received

* *Memo Field Example:**

- Before submission: "Not Submit"
- After submission: "Submit in Textura 10/8"
- Indicates October 8th submission through Textura platform
- Prevents double billing
- Tracks submission status

* *Problem with Locking:**

- Don locks QuickBooks periods monthly
- Supposed to lock first week of month
- Kendra often submits billing 20th-25th of month
- Cannot update memo after period locked
- "I can't update anything on it at all after he locks it the first week of the month, which is why there's a big problem with the whole system"
- Breaks communication method that worked for years

### Invoice vs. Contract Billing Comparison

* *Invoice Characteristics:**

- Create and send immediately
- Customer pays within their normal terms (30-60 days typically)
- No retention usually
- Simple process
- "Really easy and we wish everything was by invoice"
- Can send whenever work complete
- Faster payment cycle

* *Contract Characteristics:**

- Must wait for monthly billing window
- 10% retention (or other percentage)
- Retention not paid until project completion
- Schedule of values required
- Platform submission required
- Subject to rejection and revision
- 60+ day payment cycles typical
- More complex, more delays
- "Can only submit something once a month"

* *Timing Reality:**

- Work done October 8, 9, 12
- Billing window opens October 20
- Submit October 20-25
- Customer processes (could take days/weeks)
- Payment processed (60 days typical)
- Receive payment December-January
- But 10% retention held until project completion (could be 2+ years)

### Multi-Service Billing Complexity

* *Reality:**

- "Most of the time" jobs have multiple service lines
- SWPPP + temp fence + porta-johns + roll-offs + sweeping
- Each service may bill differently

  - SWPPP contract via Textura
  - Temp fence invoice separate
  - Porta-john invoice separate
  - Dust control invoice separate

* *Customer Decision:**

- "Depends on which job and the project manager"
- Same customer, different projects, different requirements
- No consistency even within single customer
- "They can all have different requirements"

* *Billing Coordination:**

- Kendra must track which items on contract vs. invoice
- Must bill to correct platform
- Must track retention separately
- Must coordinate with multiple directors' work completes

* *Example: Customer 3411:**

- Contract billing through Textura for SWPPP
- Separate invoice for dust control (A- prefix)
- Separate invoice for rental equipment (TF- prefix)
- All same job, same customer, different billing methods
- Must track each separately in QuickBooks

## KENDRA'S INSIGHTS & PERSPECTIVES

### On Project Management Need

> "Well, so how come 'cause I'm the only one... if there's anything different or wrong I'm the one who must take care of all of it and I'm the one who has to get the customers to respond and get me change orders and get things changed and I don't really have time to follow up."
> "Like by yourself is like how it goes. You have like project coordinators who each have so many jobs. They don't have all of this and all of this... you somebody has to manage all the bodies and the schedules."
> "Even the software we were looking at, they're like, well then your project managers have to get in here and like approve change order requests and do this and do that. I'm like, yeah, no, we don't have any of that. Don't have any of those processes."

### On QuickBooks Limitations

> "QuickBooks just is not really made for this kind of company. It's made for smaller... companies."
> "We definitely need some different software."
> "You can't really adjust anything in there. So the only thing we have are the invoice numbers and then we have whatever in the memo."

### On Contract Process Issues

> "To me it's always a surprise... because I have have no idea what we're doing until I go to bill for it. And then when I go to bill for it, I realize it's something brand new that was never even in the contract. So that's the kind of thing that shouldn't happen."
> "We should know ahead of time that it's not... and that's how we could get the change order request out to them right away and get it change order... it shouldn't just be all of a sudden they want you to bill that month and oh shit I can't because this wasn't even on the contract."

### On Customer Responsiveness

> "Customers don't answer very often... Unless of course they want the job started immediately. But if if the con if we already installed and then we get the contract and I need to get changes on it Then it's really difficult to get because they don't really care."
> "Then they might just ignore me for another four months. So we might have [change orders] sitting there for and that happens all the time. It's very, very often."

### On MT Builders (Best Customer)

> "They're amazing. They always send us a contract. They always are in Textura for SWIP, but everything else, they let us invoice them. And that's how they are on every single job because they have their billing department makes the rules, not the project manager. So that's the one customer. Everyone should run like MT builders. They're awesome."

### On Historical Operations

> "We have never had [tracking] we never had to lock anything. We never had to... like he wouldn't even do any of the crap... Rec reconciliations... He wouldn't do that till like one he'd do one at the end of the year for since January and then he'd be asking us questions. So what happened here in February? Well, I don't freaking know."

### On Current Capacity

> "I don't have time... 'cause of the other part of all the contract stuff that I have to do."
> "Normally I don't have a set schedule of any kind... actually I don't I never do. It's just I just answer I just whatever is an urgent thing that day, I get emails all day long of we need this right now. We need this right now. We need this right now."

### On Growth Challenges

> "Right now it's not you can't really grow... There's there's... well what I see is immediately... there's no way to immediately see the forecast... no way to forecast material wise or people wise on anything."

### On What's Needed

> "If we could get someone smart like you and to find some software that would help... I hope you can figure out because that would be great."

- --

## NOTABLE QUOTES

### On Daily Reality

> "I just answer I just whatever is an urgent thing that day, I get emails all day long of we need this right now. We need this right now. We need this right now."

### On Billing Complexity

> "I have to do the... schedule values for all the contract work. So I have to put the scheduled values together and then I have to match them up with the scheduled values and then I have to so most of the time we put in more than we're supposed to. So then I have to go back to the customer then and get a change order for the difference."

### On Multiple Platforms

> "I get hundreds and hundreds of them [emails] a month... I have it all go to a separate folder" [regarding Textura]

### On Equipment Tracking

> "How much temp fence do we have right now? How much temp fence do we own?" → "Oh gosh... No... a lot."

### On Remote Work Challenges

> "I have to have that happen all the time because I can't work without QuickBooks. But they can't get it to work outside of logging in and having a desktop down at the office."

### On Contract Delays

> "We started doing work in December of last year... the job actually started [in July]... But now still they haven't set us in a texture... and now I'm not ever gonna be able to update my memo."

### On The Transition

> "Truly, we're all behind, you know?"

### On Job Naming Chaos

> "Sometimes again we have lots of jobs with them... it's can be... maybe it should go on the job. I don't know. I just never did it that way before."
> "The estimate a lot of times is named something different because that was what was on the plan. And then when they send out a contract or even in their email, they name it something completely different... And then people look at just the estimate, they don't look at the contract and they name it that and then... other people and no one has any idea what anyone's talking about because they're all different. And we don't even know they're the same job."

### On Industry Standard vs. Reality

> "I mean that is normally how it works so everyone who ever talks to me [says so]... It's like, well, so how come 'cause I'm the only one."

### On Hope for Future

> "If we're all on the same page... We could just do it and pay us for it regardless."

## CONCLUSION

Kendra Ash is the linchpin of Desert Services' financial operations, managing an extraordinarily complex web of billing platforms, contract negotiations, payment tracking, and compliance requirements. Her 17+ years of institutional knowledge make her irreplaceable, but also create dangerous single points of failure. The company has outgrown QuickBooks and manual Excel tracking systems, creating inefficiencies and capacity constraints that limit growth.

The biggest opportunities for improvement center on implementing proper project management structure, dedicating resources to contract coordination, investing in construction-specific software, and systematizing processes that currently exist only in Kendra's head. The transition from Mike Lane's cash-based operation to Tim's formalized accounting requirements has created new challenges (locked periods, audits, compliance) without providing new tools to handle increased complexity.

Kendra's willingness to offer training sessions ("you can call me and I can always just have you watch me go through billing") demonstrates both her collaborative nature and the urgent need to document and distribute her knowledge before it becomes a crisis. Her insight that "the software we were looking at, they're like, well then your project managers have to get in here and like approve change order requests... I'm like, yeah, no, we don't have any of that" perfectly captures the gap between industry standards and current operations.
