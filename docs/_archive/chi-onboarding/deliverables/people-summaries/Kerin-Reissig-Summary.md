* *Interviewee:** Kerin Reissig
* *Role/Title:** Billing Coordinator (PJs & Roll-Offs) + Signage Coordinator
* *Service Families:** Portable Toilets & Sanitation (PJs), Roll-Off Dumpster Rentals (RO)
* *Execution System:** CRO software
* *Interview Duration:** 30 minutes

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kerin Reissig manages billing operations for two service families (PJs and roll-offs) while also coordinating signage procurement for dust permits, fire department access, and SWPPP compliance across all projects. She processes approximately 500 invoices per month (~25/day) using a manual workflow: pulling weekly reports from CRO, manually entering invoices into QuickBooks, and handling accounts receivable follow-up. Despite CRO's billing module capabilities, the company doesn't utilize automated export-to-QuickBooks functionality, resulting in significant manual data entry. Kerin also fields 15-20 customer calls daily from the answering service, assists with hydrometer tracking/billing (water usage measurement), and coordinates sign orders through Sandstorm Signs with next-day turnaround. Originally intended to help with PJ day-to-day operations (now delegated to Stephen), her role has evolved into pure billing/administrative support. Critical pain points: contracts distributed to entire team requiring manual review, scattered information about signage requirements, lack of integration between CRO and QuickBooks, and dependence on email confirmations for billing protection.

## BILLING PROCESS & WORKFLOW

### Roll-Off Billing

* *Frequency:**

- Weekly billing cycle (standard)
- Some customers billed monthly (based on agreement)
- One-off jobs: Immediate invoice when possible

* *Process:**

1. Pull weekly report from CRO
2. Review completed services
3. Manually input invoices into QuickBooks
4. Send invoices to customers
5. Track accounts receivable

* *Data Source:**

- CRO software (Wendy inputs hours and service data)
- Direct integration exists but not utilized

### Portable Toilet (PJ) Billing

* *Frequency:**

- Monthly invoices for regular/recurring customers
- Immediate billing for one-off jobs

* *Process:**

1. Maintain list of regular monthly customers
2. Pull data from CRO
3. Manually input invoices into QuickBooks
4. Handle one-offs as completed
5. AR follow-up

* *Complexity:**

- More complex than roll-offs (per Kerin's assessment)
- Higher volume of recurring customers
- More frequent service calls and changes

### Manual Invoice Entry

* *Current State:**

- ~25 invoices per day
- ~500 invoices per month
- All manual data entry from CRO → QuickBooks
- "Pretty manual process for invoices"

* *Why Manual:**

- "The input to QuickBooks is the same"
- "The source of the information is different, because she gets info directly from CRO"
- Company not using CRO's billing export functionality

### Accounts Receivable

* *AR Management:**

- "Try and chase people when things [AR outstanding]"
- Follow-up on overdue invoices
- Collections efforts
- No specific metrics mentioned

- --

## SIGNAGE COORDINATION

### Signage Requirements by Type

* *1. Maricopa County Dust Signage**

- Required when: Dust permit obtained (if under 5 acres)
- Must include

  - Responsible party contact name
  - Phone number (must match dust permit)
  - Must match who's onsite

- Changes: Required when superintendent or responsible party changes

* *2. Fire Department Access Signs**

- Size: 4x4
- Must include

  - Responsible party contact name
  - Phone number
  - Street address (must match permit)

- Updates: Use stickers over existing signage if name changes

* *3. SWPPP Signage**

- Required: NOI (Notice of Intent) from general contractor
- Exception: If GC files for NDC, no SWPPP signage needed
- Changes: Usually don't change once installed

* *4. Specialty Signage**

- Custom requirements per project
- Varies by customer/contract

* *5. Pima County Dust Signage**

- County-specific requirements

* *6. Pinal County Dust Signage**

- County-specific requirements

### Signage Procurement Process

* *Vendor:**

- Sandstorm Signs (primary supplier)
- Set rates for standard signs
- Fast turnaround: "Can get signs in as little as a day"
- Free pickup, charge for delivery

* *Ordering Process:**

1. Contract comes through indicating sign requirements
2. Check for NOI or dust permit requirements
3. Kerin sends formatted email to Sandstorm

    - Template exists for requests
    - Standard rates established
4. Signs produced (1-day turnaround possible)
5. Pickup or delivery arranged
6. Kerin bills customer for signs and dust permits

* *Timing Critical:**
> "Signs shouldn't be made until permits come through. When install date is set, signs should be ordered. When they go on the trip, they should have all the stuff in place when they go."

### Signage Tracking & Compliance

* *Current Tracking:**

- Kerin started a spreadsheet of signs sent out
- Previously easier when signs made in-house
- Now outsourced to Sandstorm

* *Compliance Verification:**

- Inspectors and sales contact Kerin if mismatch identified
- "Are they checking and making sure this is in line?"
- Email confirmation required for sign changes

* *Update Triggers:**

- Superintendent changes → Update dust/fire signs
- Responsible party changes → Update all relevant signage
- Project on hold for months → Check if anything changed

  - Dust permit may need updating if project delayed

* *Cross-Company Coordination:**
> "Need to figure out who is doing a dust permit - if it's another company, we should interact with them and keep track."

## TECHNOLOGY & SYSTEMS

### CRO Software

* *Current Use:**

- Scheduling (primary function)
- Service tracking
- Reporting (weekly pulls for billing)
- Data storage for PJ and RO services

* *Underutilized Features:**

- Billing module exists
- Export to QuickBooks functionality available
- Company not leveraging automated billing

* *Opportunity Identified:**
> "Look into the billing side of CRO → might be able to export from CRO to QuickBooks"
> "They've changed things since we started CRO - can look at the billing side."
> "Billing through CRO could be setup. Roll-offs are a simpler process, PJs more difficult."

### QuickBooks

* *Current Use:**

- Invoice entry (manual)
- Accounts receivable tracking
- Financial records

* *Process:**

- Kerin manually inputs invoice data from CRO reports
- "The input to QuickBooks is the same, the source of the information is different"

### Spreadsheets

* *Sign Tracking:**

- Kerin created spreadsheet to track signs sent out
- Necessity arose when sign production moved from in-house to Sandstorm
- Tracks what signs ordered, for which projects, when sent

### Answering Service

* *Volume:**

- 15-20 calls per day forwarded to Kerin
- Customer questions about PJs and roll-offs
- Driver questions and support

* *Problem:**

- Entire team receives contracts
- Each person must review to determine if relevant to their area
- No centralized assignment or routing
- Inefficient, requires manual scanning

* *Fed By:**

- Contract/estimate work (for signage)
- CRO data (for billing)
- Answering service (for customer inquiries)
- Direct driver calls
- Inspector/sales coordination

### Email Confirmations Critical

* *Requirement:**
> "Get email confirmation of work → need to change dust/fire signs if super changes"

* *Why:**

- Billing protection (pattern across company)
- Documentation of changes
- Audit trail for permit compliance
- CYA for collections disputes

- --

## SPECIALIZED SERVICES

* *Process:**

- Company sets up hydrometer
- External company certifies
- Kerin tracks usage
- Bills customer for water consumption

### Backflow Services

* *Capabilities:**

- Company can fix own backflow equipment
- Setup in-house
- External certification required

* *Coordination:**
> "If we have a backflow on there or if we set up the hydrometer, then we have to help"

- --

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### Challenge #1: Manual Billing Process

* *Current State:**

- 500 invoices/month manually entered
- Pull CRO report → Manual QB entry
- Time-consuming, error-prone
- No automation despite CRO capability

* *Impact:**

- ~25 invoices/day requiring manual data entry
- Opportunity cost: Time could be spent on higher-value activities
- Risk of data entry errors
- Inefficient use of technology

* *Root Cause:**

- CRO billing module not configured for QB export
- Company hasn't invested in integration setup
- "They've changed things since we started CRO - can look at the billing side"

### Challenge #2: Contract Distribution Chaos

* *The Problem:**
> "Info is scattered → contracts go out to everyone, and individuals have to figure out what's necessary"

* *Impact:**

- Everyone must review all contracts
- Manual determination of relevance
- Time wasted on irrelevant contracts
- Risk of missing important requirements

* *What's Needed:**

- Centralized contract review
- Role-based distribution
- Highlighted sections per person
- Chi's potential role: Contract coordinator

### Challenge #3: Signage Information Fragmentation

* *Issues:**

- Requirements embedded in contracts
- Must extract permit details manually
- Coordination across inspectors, sales, operations
- No centralized sign order tracker (Kerin created own spreadsheet)

* *Compliance Risk:**

- Signs ordered before permits received
- Mismatches between signs and permits
- Responsible party changes not communicated
- Inspectors catching errors in field

* *Timing Challenges:**
> "Signs shouldn't be made until permits come through. When install date is set, signs should be ordered."

* *Reality:**

- Unclear handoffs between estimating → operations → signage
- Install dates not always communicated to Kerin
- Rush orders when communication breaks down

### Challenge #4: Answering Service Volume

* *Current State:**

- 15-20 calls/day routed to Kerin
- Interrupts billing workflow
- Driver questions (should go to operations?)
- Customer inquiries (could be handled by service?)

* *Questions:**

- Are calls appropriately routed?
- Should drivers call Stephen (PJ operations) instead?
- Could answering service screen better?
- Does Kerin need dedicated phone support time?

### Challenge #5: Cross-Company Dust Permit Tracking

* *The Issue:**
> "Need to figure out who is doing a dust permit - if it's another company, we should interact with them and keep track."

* *Scenarios:**

- Some GCs use their own dust permit providers
- Desert Services needs to coordinate signage
- Unclear who's responsible for what
- Tracking gaps when third parties involved

* *Project Hold Complications:**
> "If project is put on hold (couple months) - need to check if anything has changed. If dust permit would change, we need to change it ourselves."

### Challenge #6: PJ Billing Complexity

* *Kerin's Assessment:**
> "Billing through CRO could be setup. Roll-offs are a simpler process, PJs more difficult."

* *Why PJs Are Complex:**

- Higher volume of recurring customers
- More frequent service changes
- Multiple service tiers (pumping frequency varies)
- Emergency/one-off services mixed with recurring
- Customer-specific pricing and terms

## CONCLUSION

Kerin Reissig manages critical billing and signage coordination functions that directly impact company cashflow and regulatory compliance, yet operates with significant manual inefficiencies and fragmented information flows. The most impactful improvement opportunity is CRO-to-QuickBooks integration for billing automation, which could save 10-15 hours weekly and reduce errors in the 500 monthly invoices she processes. Contract distribution chaos creates unnecessary work across the entire team, including Kerin reviewing full contracts to extract signage requirements—a perfect use case for Chi's coordinator role. Signage coordination is complex (6 types, permit dependencies, timing critical) but well-managed through Kerin's personal systems; formalizing these into shared tools would improve visibility and reduce project delays. The answering service routes 15-20 calls daily to Kerin despite many being operational questions better suited for Stephen or Wendy, suggesting call routing refinement could free significant focus time. Kerin's domain expertise in billing cycles, permit requirements, and vendor relationships is valuable; removing manual data entry burdens would allow her to focus on higher-value activities like AR collections, compliance verification, and cross-company coordination.
