## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Rick Haitaian serves as Sales Manager at Desert Services, overseeing the sales process and activities for all service families. Since joining 5 months ago, Rick has implemented fundamental sales improvements including a systematic follow-up process on submitted bids and estimates—a practice that did not exist previously. He actively monitors lead generation sources (particularly Maricopa Dust Permits), tracks sales activities through Monday.com's Last Activity Column, and manages a structured sales team with defined territories. Despite these improvements, Rick identifies significant gaps in the organization including a "loosey goosey" sales process with no standardized handoff procedures, complete absence of inventory tracking for capacity planning, and no formal business planning framework. The company maintains an 18% conversion goal on estimates, though Rick notes this metric may be inflated as the company bids on multiple projects for single opportunities.

## SALES PROCESS & ACTIVITIES

### Sales Follow-Up Process

* *Historical Context:**

- As of 5 months ago (when Rick started), there was NO follow-up on submitted bids/estimates
- Rick has since implemented a systematic follow-up system
- Represents a fundamental improvement in sales operations

* *Current Follow-Up Methods:**

- Combination of emails and phone calls (scope-dependent)
- Follow-up ensures estimate receipt by customer
- Includes attachment of cut sheets and supporting documentation
- Rick tracks all sales activities via the Last Activity Column in Monday.com

* *Brandon and Lacey's Role Evolution:**

- Original job function: Relationship building only
- Since implementation of new process, responsibilities have expanded
- Now more involved in active sales activities beyond pure relationship development

### Lead Generation

* *Current Lead Sources:**

1. **Maricopa Dust Permits Website**

    - Rick actively monitors this site for opportunities
    - Primary source for proactive lead generation

2. **Relationship Building with General Contractors**

    - Ongoing relationship development with GC partners
    - Leverages existing customer base for new opportunities

## BIDDING PROCESS

### Primary Focus Areas

* *SWPPP as Main Focus:**

- Main bidding focus: SWPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan)
- Estimators receive projects first and bid out major projects (SWPPP included)
- Superintendents or Project Managers handle local decisions for smaller items

  - Temporary fencing
  - Porta Johns (PJs)
  - Other site services

### Bid Outcome Tracking

* *Two Types of Losses Identified:**

1. **General Contractor Lost the Overall Bid**

    - Desert Services' estimate was competitive
    - GC did not win the prime contract
    - Loss not related to Desert Services' pricing or performance

2. **Company Lost Specifically to a Competitor**

    - GC won the prime contract
    - Selected different subcontractor for services
    - Direct competitive loss

### Performance Metrics

* *Conversion Rate Goal:**

- Target: 18% conversion rate on estimates
- Note: Metric not fully reflective of true win rate
- Reason: Company bids on multiple projects for single opportunities
- Example: May submit 5 bids for one large opportunity, counting each separately

* *Competitive Positioning:**

- According to Rick's assessment: Bids are likely NOT being lost due to pricing
- Suggests losses may be due to other factors

  - Relationship strength
  - Response time
  - Service quality perception
  - Contract terms

## CONCLUSION

Rick Haitaian has made meaningful improvements to Desert Services' sales function in his first 5 months, particularly implementing a follow-up process where none existed. However, significant opportunities remain to formalize the sales process, implement inventory and capacity planning systems, and create a business planning framework. The company's 18% conversion goal, combined with Rick's assessment that losses are not primarily due to pricing, suggests opportunities to improve through better process, planning, and relationship management. The recent launch of Lunch and Learn events, proactive monitoring of lead sources, and structured territory assignments provide a foundation for continued growth. The most critical next steps are formalizing the sales-to-operations handoff process and implementing an inventory tracking system to prevent margin erosion on large material-intensive projects like the 10,000-foot fence example.
