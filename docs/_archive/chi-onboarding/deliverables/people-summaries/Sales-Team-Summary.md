## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The sales team manages relationships with the top 100+ general contractors, conducting site visits and upselling additional services beyond initial SWPPP contracts. Despite strong relationship-building capabilities and growing business, the team faces critical workflow breakdowns: zero notification when projects are won, missing project information (PM names, addresses, start dates), fragmented communication across service divisions, and an inadequate CRM system (Monday.com) that lacks proper account hierarchy and integration. The team spends excessive time hunting for basic project information rather than selling, discovers active job sites only by driving past them, and cannot track service issues systematically. Primary needs: formalized sales-to-operations handoff process, project win notifications with complete information, proper CRM with account-based structure, and unified visibility across all service lines.

## WORKFLOW BREAKDOWN: THE CORE PROBLEM

### Current State - "Loosey Goosey"

* *What Should Happen:**

1. Jared estimates SWPPP job
2. Bid goes out to GC
3. Rick follows up on bid status
4. GC wins project → Rick gets PM name, address, start date
5. Rick notifies sales team with complete information
6. Sales contacts PM immediately to upsell additional services
7. Sales coordinates with division directors for setup
8. Project tracked in CRM with all services visible
9. Contract finalized and sent to operations

* *What Actually Happens:**

1. Jared estimates SWPPP job
2. Bid goes out (sometimes entered in Monday, sometimes not)
3. ??? [Black hole - no one follows up consistently]
4. Sales discovers project by **driving past active construction site**
5. Sales sees Desert Services signs already installed
6. Sales has no idea: Who's the PM? What services do we have? How did we get this?
7. Sales scrambles to find information from multiple people
8. By this time, other services already set up by competitors

### Critical Missing Pieces

* *No Win Notification:**
> "There's no workflow whatsoever. There's no follow-up as far as we won the project and then alerting us." - Lacie

* *Example Scenarios:**

- Lacie driving to job, sees Hayden project with SWPPP signs, had zero knowledge job existed
- Michael pulls up to Chipotle, sees 4 Desert Services roll-offs, two full, didn't know project started
- Projects marked "not started" in Monday but already halfway done in field

* *Missing Information When Projects Are Won:**

- No PM name or contact
- No job site address
- No start date
- No confirmation which services were actually contracted
- Sometimes just "bid won" status with nothing else

* *Impact:**
> "Once a site has started, if you're going out there and they have already broke ground on that site, fat chance on upselling them on anything. Because they've all... if they have broke ground and started, PJs are gonna be out there. Fence is up. They'll have at least one roll-off dumpster out there." - Michael

## SALES PROCESS & INTAKE

### Lead Sources

* *1. Dust Permits (Rick monitors)**

- Maricopa County dust permit database
- Indicates new construction starting
- Rick supposed to follow up and qualify leads

* *2. Bid Requests from GCs**

- GC estimators send bid invitations
- Goes to Jared for SWPPP estimates
- Entered into Monday (sometimes)
- Rick supposed to follow up post-submission

* *3. Relationship-Driven (Proactive)**

- Sales visiting sites regularly
- Building superintendent relationships
- Getting early notification of upcoming projects
- Example: Michael in contact with Chase PM about new high school before official bid

* *4. "Lunch and Learns"**

- Recently started (~2 events so far)
- Present company capabilities to GC teams
- Establish annual/2-year pricing agreements
- Goal: Become preferred vendor with locked pricing

### Bidding Process

* *Primary Focus: SWPPP**

- SWPPP required in GC's construction plans
- Must be budgeted for permits and approvals
- Estimators request SWPPP bids during pre-construction
- Other services (PJs, fence, roll-offs) not typically in initial bid

* *Why Other Services Not Bid Initially:**

- SWPPP built into GC's budget (required by plans/permits)
- Other services come from different budget line (operations)
- Some GCs want everything bid together, most don't
- PMs/Supers handle other services after project awarded

* *Estimate Format Issues:**

- SWPPP estimate shows full detail with line-item total
- Additional services listed as pricing sheets (no quantities/totals)
- Estimators prefer this (easy to forward just SWPPP portion)
- Problem: Company can't forecast true project value
- $30K SWPPP estimate might become $200K with all services

* *Conversion Metrics:**

- Goal: 18% conversion rate on estimates
- Not fully accurate (company bids multiple variations per opportunity)
- No systematic tracking of win/loss reasons

* *Competitive Position:**

- Rick believes pricing NOT the issue
- Sales team believes pricing IS a major issue (along with relationships)
- Recent price increase implemented during sales team's first 6 months
- Difficult to assess impact without baseline data

- --

## TERRITORY & ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

### Top 80 System (Monday.com)

* *Structure:**

- Each salesperson has "Top 80" board in Monday
- Lists assigned GC accounts
- Supposed to visit each site monthly
- Document services in use (ours and competitors)
- Inspection reports with notes

* *Project Opportunities Board:**

- Sites not in Top 80 but worth pursuing
- Opportunistic visits when in area
- Don't need monthly cadence

* *New Projects Board:**

- Jared supposed to move won bids here
- Should mark "bid won"
- Automation supposed to assign to appropriate salesperson based on GC
- Reality: Automation doesn't work, manual assignment required

### Account Hierarchy Problem

* *What Sales Team Needs:**

```text
General Contractor (Account)
├── Estimators & Contacts
├── PMs & Superintendents
├── Leads (Prospective Projects)
├── Active Projects
│   ├── Project A
│   │   ├── Services (SWPPP, PJ, Fence, RO, WT, SW, Cleaning)

```text

__What Monday.com Provides:__

- Flat list of projects
- No account-level organization
- Can't see all Hayden projects in one place
- Can't see all services on a project in one view
- Inspection reports in separate section from projects
- Living in "two different sections of Monday"

__Impact:__
> "I should be able to go into Hayden's account and see all of their projects. And all of their leads. Upcoming projects, current projects, past projects, everything should be in their account." - Lacie

- --

## TECHNOLOGY & TOOLS

### Current Technology: Monday.com

__Used For:__

- Top 80 account tracking
- Project opportunities
- Site inspection reports
- New project notifications (supposed to)
- Activity logging
- Mapping (doesn't work well)

__Critical Limitations:__

__1. Not a True CRM:__
> "To call it a CRM is, with respect, to call it a CRM is... Yeah. It's a Notion kind of copy paste or something." - Chi

__2. No Account Hierarchy:__

- Can't organize by customer
- Everything project-based
- No way to see all customer projects together

__3. Poor Integration:__

- Sales team uses Monday
- Operations divisions don't (Excel, CRO, paper)
- No visibility across departments
- "Each business line runs separately. They don't talk to each other."

__4. Mapping Issues:__

- Maps exist but "kind of funky"
- Multiple salespeople share dashboards
- Filters get messed up between users
- Recently added Michael, system got wonky

__5. No Case/Issue Tracking:__

- Can't log service failures
- No way to track complaints systematically
- Issues handled ad-hoc, then forgotten
- Example: Lacie lost PJ contract due to repeated trailer filling misses, but no record

### Technology Gaps

__Communication:__

- No company phones for sales team
- No direct lines to division directors
- Must have personal cell numbers
- Sales email shared by everyone (messy)

__Service Visibility:__
> "I'm going in there and it looks silly. You know, it's like... I have no idea we're doing sweeping. Are we coming out for inspections? And they're like, no, not inspections, but you're sweeping out here." - Michael

__Project Information:__

- No centralized project database
- Can't check what services are on which sites
- Kelly (sweeping) writes everything on paper, sends photos to Dawn weekly
- No one knows about service calls until end of week

__Mapping:__

- Logan (inspector) uses Compliance Go ($10/month)
- Can organize routes by day
- Map shows all projects in area
- Sales wants similar capability

### Desired Technology Solutions

__Service Titan (Preferred by Lacie):__

- Used at previous company (75 people, home builder)
- Handles work orders, invoicing, billing, scheduling
- Customer portal for work order requests
- Logging cases/issues
- All-in-one operations management
- Cheaper than Salesforce/HubSpot

__Salesforce (Gold Standard):__

- Proper account hierarchy
- Cases tracking
- Full activity logging
- Great mapping
- Expensive
- Michael's previous employer (State Farm) used it with screen recording integration

__HubSpot:__

- Second most popular CRM
- More affordable than Salesforce
- Has free tier (too limited for this use case)

__Key Requirements:__

- Account-based organization (not project-based)
- Integration with operations (or replace operations systems)
- Case/issue tracking
- Mapping functionality
- Work order management
- Mobile accessibility

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW GAPS

### Gap #1: Sales-to-Operations Handoff

__The Problem:__
> "There's no workflow whatsoever." - Lacie

__Missing Process:__

- When bid won, who gets notified?
- What information must be collected?
- Who enters into operations systems?
- How do division directors know to prepare?
- How is contract finalized?
- When does setup begin?

__Current State:__

- Sometimes Jason (SWPPP ops) gets called directly by GC
- Sometimes sales finds out by accident
- Sometimes project starts without anyone knowing
- Operations directors don't know about new work

__Needed:__

1. Bid won → Rick qualifies (PM, address, start date)
2. Rick enters into CRM with complete info
3. Automatic notification to: Sales (assigned), Jared, Jayson, Kendra
4. Sales reaches out within 24 hours to upsell
5. Sales updates CRM with additional services needed
6. Jared generates updated estimate
7. Contract signed and distributed
8. Operations notified with complete project package

### Gap #2: Pre-Qualification & Inventory Planning

__No Capacity Planning:__

- Example: Won project needing 10,000 ft of fence
- Discovered after win, had to purchase immediately
- Lost margin on rush procurement
- No business planning for materials/equipment

__No Pre-Qualification Packets:__

- Should start with Mike Hammonds (new business)
- Need: Safety docs, insurance, W-9, company info
- No standard packet exists
- No defined storage location

### Gap #3: Bid Tracking & Follow-Up

__Historical Context:__

- 5 months ago: ZERO follow-up on submitted bids
- Rick implemented follow-up system
- Emails and phone calls to check status
- Tracks via "Last Activity" column

__Current Problems:__

- 3,000+ bids in Monday queue
- No systematic follow-up on all of them
- Rick focuses on high-dollar opportunities
- No tracking of why bids lost
- Two loss types identified: (1) GC lost overall bid, (2) Lost to competitor
- According to Kendra: No one actually knows win rate

__Needed Information When Following Up:__

1. Did GC win the overall project?
2. If yes, did we win the SWPPP portion?
3. If lost, why? (Price vs. relationship vs. other)
4. If won: PM name, contact, address, start date
5. Immediate handoff to sales for upselling window

### Gap #4: Cross-Division Visibility

__Service Silos:__
> "Each business line runs separately. They don't talk to each other. Like sweeping doesn't know if water trucks is there." - Lacie

__Impact:__

- Sales visiting site not knowing what services company provides there
- Looks unprofessional to customer
- Multiple Desert Services people showing up uncoordinated
- Can't proactively manage white-glove accounts

__Kelly's Paper System:__

- Kelly (sweeping director) uses notebook
- Writes down all service calls
- Sends photo of notes to Dawn at end of week
- Dawn manually enters for billing
- No one else knows what's happening until week-end
- Unacceptable per Chi

__Needed:__

- Real-time service dispatch visibility
- Unified project dashboard showing all active services
- Sales can check "what are we doing at this site?" before visiting
- Division directors can see other divisions' activity

### Gap #5: Issue/Case Tracking

__Current State:__
> "As things come up, they're issues, you fix it, and that's the end of it. And then it happens again next week." - Lacie

__No System For:__

- Logging service failures
- Tracking complaint patterns
- Trending problems by division/crew/site
- Holding divisions accountable with data

__Example:__

- Lacie's PJ contract: Lost big project due to repeated trailer filling misses
- She brought up to water division multiple times
- No documentation of issues
- No tracking of frequency
- Lost revenue with no accountability

__What's Needed (Cases in Salesforce):__

- Log: Date, customer, service line, issue type, description
- Assign to responsible party
- Track resolution time
- Pull monthly reports: "Why are sweepers not showing up 17 times this month?"
- Address systemic issues with data

- --

## PRICING & COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS

### Pricing as Win/Loss Factor

__Sales Team Perspective:__
> "It's either price or it's relationships. Like they have a relationship with Waste Management and they get tickets to the Phoenix Open. That's a reason. Or they get a better price from someone else." - Lacie

__Pricing Issues:__

- Recent price increase during sales team's first 6 months
- Difficult timing: Building relationships while increasing prices
- Can't assess impact without baseline performance data

__Specific Pain Points:__

__Temp Fence:__

- Competitors: $0.25/linear foot/month (rock bottom)
- Desert Services: $1.35/linear foot/month
- Huge gap, losing fence work regularly
- "Pricing is absolutely absolutely an issue. Not for everybody like Clayco... but then there's other companies that very much care."

__Roll-Offs:__

- Not price to dump
- Issue: Overage fees after 25-28 days without dump
- $25/day penalty if dumpster sits 40+ days
- Competitors (Weinberger, etc.) don't charge overage fees
- Sales team losing roll-off contracts due to this policy
- "Main pain point" for roll-offs

### Pricing Authority & Discounting

__Current State:__

- Sales can give pricing for PJs, fence, basic services
- SWPPP quotes require Jared
- No formal discount authority defined
- Bundle pricing discussed but not formalized

__Tim's Direction (from recent sales meeting):__

- Wants to provide discount ranges sales can use
- If within range: Sales has authority
- If outside range: Must get Tim approval
- Not yet implemented

__Bundle Discount Philosophy:__
> "The more services you use, the bigger discount you get. We haven't put that into place necessarily. We're bidding job by job." - Lacie

__Annual Pricing Agreements:__

- Tim wants sales to pitch annual/2-year contracts
- GCs do pricing refreshes every 1-2 years
- Locks pricing with preferred vendor status
- Reduces estimator work (they have pricing on file, no quote requests needed)
- Not systematically implemented yet

### Competitive Intelligence Gap

__No Win/Loss Analysis:__

- Don't know why losing bids systematically
- Field feedback only (anecdotal)
- Can't demonstrate to Tim: "Look, we're losing X projects due to roll-off overage policy"
- Can't prioritize pricing/policy changes with data

__Competitor Example: Weinberger:__

- "Fucking huge" per Michael
- Recently purchased Premier Waste Connection
- Have dedicated dump station yard
- More competitive on roll-offs

- --

## ESTIMATING & QUOTING PROCESS

### Current Process

__SWPPP Estimates (Jared):__

1. GC sends bid request
2. Jared reviews plans and site requirements
3. Creates detailed estimate with line items
4. Sends to GC estimator
5. (Optional) Includes pricing sheets for other services

__Other Services:__

- Sales can quote PJs, fence, etc. directly from pricing
- Simple email: "You need 3 PJs, here's the pricing, please confirm"
- No formal quote document required
- Must get email confirmation (required for billing protection)

__Issues:__

__Problem 1: Estimate Reuse__

- Jared copies previous estimates and modifies
- Sometimes forgets to change GC name
- Example: Sends Leyton estimate to Sotela with Leyton's name still on it
- Customers notice, looks unprofessional
- Need templates instead of copy/paste

__Problem 2: No Forecasting__

- SWPPP estimate: $30K
- Don't know value of other services until sold
- Project might actually be $200K total
- Can't forecast revenue accurately
- Can't prioritize sales efforts

__Problem 3: At-Risk Bids Are Different__

- Some projects bid as full "at-risk" packages
- Jared spends hours calculating all services for project life
- Provides total project value
- Rare, very time-consuming
- Example: Clayco at-risk bid = $275K (all 7 services)

### Quote Distribution & Visibility

__Who Gets Estimate:__

- GC estimator (during bid phase)
- Not automatically sent to sales
- Sales doesn't know estimate sent unless they ask
- Sales doesn't know project details unless they hunt

__What Sales Needs:__

1. Notification when estimate sent
2. Copy of estimate
3. GC contact information
4. Project details (address, scope, timeline)
5. Ability to follow up proactively

__Current Reality:__

- Sales discovers estimates after the fact
- Can't coordinate relationship-building during bid phase
- Missing opportunity to influence decision early

- --

## INTERNAL COORDINATION CHALLENGES

### Division Directors Communication

__Who Sales Coordinates With:__

- Jared (estimating)
- Jayson (SWPPP operations)
- Daniel (water trucks, cleaning)
- Kelly (sweeping)
- Kerin (PJs)
- Wendy (roll-offs)
- Kendra (contracts, billing)
- Jason (operations, scheduling - frequent contact)

__Communication Methods:__

- Email (required for all service requests)
- Phone calls
- Text messages
- In-person

__Challenges:__

__No Direct Lines:__
> "Like if I need to reach Don, I have no direct line to them unless I have their personal cell phone." - Lacie

__Response Time Issues:__

- Sales needs fast response for customer requests
- Some directors more responsive than others
- No SLA or expectation setting
- Customers expect immediate answers

__Service Requests Must Be in Email:__
> "In the customer service side... construction industry: 'I need an email.' Everything must be in email form for billing protection." - Context from James Neal summary

__Why:__

- Don (billing) fighting customers to get paid
- Verbal agreements lead to non-payment disputes
- Without email, no documentation = no collection
- Company has blacklist of non-paying GCs
- "We were trying to take care of the customer" but got burned

### White-Glove vs. Standard Accounts

__White-Glove Service (Examples: Clayco, RJ Arterra):__

- Weekly foreman meetings attendance
- All 7 services provided
- Sales is single point of contact
- Proactive issue management
- Site visits 2x per week
- Sales does inspections (checks PJ cleanliness, roll-off fill levels, etc.)
- Very high touch

__Standard Accounts:__

- Monthly site visit
- Reactive problem-solving
- GCs call when they need something
- Less proactive management

__Challenge:__

- White-glove accounts require extensive time
- Takes away from prospecting and new relationship building
- Role becoming project management, not sales
- "Are these project managers or are they salespeople?"

### Role Confusion: Sales vs. Account Management vs. Project Management

__Original Job Description:__

- Build relationships with top GCs
- Visit sites regularly
- Upsell additional services
- Be responsive customer contact

__Reality:__

- All of above PLUS
- Solve operational problems in field
- Coordinate between multiple division directors
- Project manage white-glove accounts
- Attend weekly foreman meetings
- Inspect service quality
- Handle customer complaints
- Fight fires constantly

__Impact:__
> "We're doing a lot of problem-solving stuff. You know, if someone calls me, we're having an issue with this, we need a sweeper, the water truck, that's not whatever..." - Lacie

- --

## ONBOARDING & KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

### New Salesperson Ramp

__What's Needed:__

- List of assigned GCs with full contact information
- Historical relationship context
- Active project list
- Service history
- Pricing authority guidelines
- CRM training
- Introduction to division directors

__What's Missing:__

- Complete GC contact database (estimators, PMs, supers)
- Clear process documentation
- Defined sales methodology
- CRM best practices
- Handoff procedures

__Michael's Experience (6 months in):__

- Top 50 GCs assigned
- Many sites never visited before him
- Often has no idea what services company provides at site
- Must call multiple people to figure out what's happening
- "I just go myself and just try to look"

### Dodge Database (Coming Soon)

__What It Provides:__

- Complete builder directory
- All active construction projects
- Project addresses
- PM/Super contact info (what they can gather)
- Updated regularly by people, not automated

__Use Cases:__

__Initial Setup (Huge Value):__

- Michael can look up all Chase active sites
- Get addresses and contacts
- Set up initial meeting schedule
- "In a month from now, Dodge isn't gonna be as useful"

__Ongoing (Moderate Value):__

- Verify new projects
- Fill gaps in information
- Check for missed opportunities

__Limitation:__

- Still requires sales to proactively check
- Doesn't push notifications
- Doesn't integrate with CRM
- Manual lookup tool

- --

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### Challenge #1: Discovery By Accident

- "I look over and I see Hayden... I had no idea that job even existed"
- "Pull up to Chipotle... there's four Desert Services roll-offs... I don't even know where I'm at right now"
- Active job sites with company equipment, sales has zero knowledge

### Challenge #2: Missing Critical Information

- "There's no address, we should be asking: Well, where is this project?"
- "I have no PM to call for information. So it's like, great, we won. That's awesome."
- "I could cold call them, which is absolutely bananas when we have [the project]"

### Challenge #3: Timing - Too Late to Upsell

- "Once the project has started, it's too late. Once they've broke ground... PJs are gonna be out there. Fence is up."
- "The minute that we start bidding on something, we should be in contact already"
- Window to add services is pre-construction to early construction

### Challenge #4: Fragmented Communication

- "It's almost too many people involved. I like to know obviously what's going on on my site."
- Sales, Jason (ops), Jared (estimating), division directors all getting contacted separately
- No central coordination, lots of duplication and missed handoffs

### Challenge #5: No Accountability

- Lost PJ contract due to repeated failures, but no documentation
- Can't demonstrate problem to management without data
- "There's no record of that other than me calling and saying, hey, you missed this again. That's not enough."

### Challenge #6: Technology Inadequacy

- Monday.com not designed for sales
- "It's a Notion kind of copy paste"
- Mapping doesn't work reliably
- No mobile optimization
- Can't see account-level view

### Challenge #7: Price Increase Timing

- Implemented during sales team's first 6-8 months
- Building new relationships while raising prices
- Can't isolate sales team impact vs. price increase impact
- No baseline data

### Challenge #8: Role Overload

- Hired to build relationships and upsell
- Actually doing: Project management, problem-solving, firefighting
- White-glove accounts are time-consuming
- Less time for prospecting and new business development

## NOTABLE QUOTES

### On Workflow Gaps

> "There's no workflow whatsoever. There's no follow-up as far as we won the project and then alerting us." - Lacie
> "I had a project yesterday... I look over and I see Hayden, which is my builder. I see our SWPPP signs. No, I had no idea that job even existed." - Lacie
> "Pull up to Chipotle, it's like halfway done. And there's four desert services roll-offs. Two are concrete ones full. And I walk in and he's like, here you guys can... And I'm like, I don't even know where I'm at right now." - Michael

### On Missing Information

> "I have no PM to call for information. So it's like, great, we won. That's awesome." - Lacie
> "I could cold call them, which is absolutely bananas." - Lacie

### On Timing

> "Once a site is started, if you're going out there and they have already broke ground on that site, fat chance on upselling them on anything... Because they've already... if they have broke ground and started, PJs are gonna be out there. Fence is up." - Michael

### On Technology

> "To call it a CRM is, with respect, to call it a CRM is..." - Chi
> "It's a Notion kind of copy paste or something... I don't think it's a CRM by any means." - Michael

### On Service Silos

> "Each business line runs separately. They don't talk to each other. Like sweeping doesn't know if water trucks is there." - Lacie

### On Issue Tracking

> "As things come up, they're issues, you fix it, and that's the end of it. And then it happens again next week." - Lacie
> "Being able to track when we're not meeting the mark is something I think we're lacking." - Lacie

### On Pricing

> "It's either price or it's relationships. Like they have a relationship with Waste Management and they get tickets to the Phoenix Open. That's a reason. Or they get a better price from someone else." - Lacie

### On Role Reality

> "We're doing a lot of problem-solving stuff. You know, if someone calls me, we're having an issue with this, we need a sweeper, the water truck, that's not whatever." - Lacie

### On Account Organization

> "I should be able to go into Hayden's account and see all of their projects. And all of their leads. Upcoming projects, current projects, past projects, everything should be in their account." - Lacie

## CONCLUSION

The sales team possesses strong relationship-building skills and customer service orientation, but operates with critical information and workflow gaps that prevent them from maximizing revenue opportunities. The core problem is not lack of effort or capability—it's systemic: projects are won without sales team notification, critical information (PM names, addresses, start dates) is missing, divisions operate in silos, and the CRM doesn't support an account-based sales model. The team spends excessive time hunting for basic information rather than selling. Quick wins are achievable through improved communication and handoff processes (Chi's immediate focus), while medium-term success requires proper CRM implementation and formalized workflows. Long-term, the role needs clarification: Are these salespeople building new relationships, or account managers serving existing customers? Currently trying to do both, plus project management, which is unsustainable as the company scales.
