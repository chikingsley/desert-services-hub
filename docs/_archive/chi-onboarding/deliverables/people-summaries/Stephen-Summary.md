# STEPHEN - COMPREHENSIVE MEETING NOTES

* *Meeting Date:** Friday, November 8, 2024
* *Interviewee:** Stephen
* *Role/Title:** Porta-John (PJ) Operations Director
* *Service Families:** Porta-Johns (Portable Restrooms)
* *Execution System:** CRO software
* *Interviewer:** Chi Ejimofor

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Stephen manages porta-john operations using CRO software for order entry, scheduling, and routing. His primary challenge is route optimization, which requires constant adjustment and can only be optimized after initial assignment. The operation lacks asset tracking (PJs are not tagged/labeled/numbered), creating difficulties when units are moved on-site by customers. He operates on a similar model to other service directors: receives calls/emails, collects required information, and enters directly into CRO without formal email confirmation at intake.

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### Challenge #1: Asset Tracking & Unit Location

* *No Tagging/Labeling System:**

* PJs are not tagged, labeled, or asset numbered in any way
* Makes tracking and inventory management difficult
* No way to identify specific units

* *Units Get Moved:**

* "Most of the time we come onsite the PJs are moved"
* Customers move units without notifying company
* Makes it difficult to find exact PJ location when servicing
* Causes operational inefficiency

* *Missing Units:**

* When PJ goes missing, customer is allegedly charged
* Cost of new unit unknown
* Worth tracking if it was easy, but TBD
* Need to investigate tracking feasibility

### Challenge #2: Route Optimization Limitations

* *CRO System Constraint:**

* Can only optimize routes AFTER assigning them
* Cannot optimize during initial route creation
* "Kinda strange that you can only optimize after the fact"

* *Continuous Optimization Needed:**

* Routes need constant adjusting and optimizing
* Must optimize often (not one-time activity)
* Time-consuming process
* "Hardest part of the job is routing"

### Challenge #3: CRO Software Underutilization & Issues

* *Not Used to Full Potential:**

* System has capabilities not being leveraged
* May be features that could help with routing, tracking, etc

* *Misuse and Unknown Issues:**

* Software being misused in some ways
* Issues occurring and team doesn't know why
* Firefighting problems rather than solving root causes

* *Training Need:**

* Need to sit down with CRO training people
* Figure out what is happening and fix properly
* Move from reactive to proactive software management

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

### Opportunity #1: Asset Tracking Implementation

* *Tagging/Labeling System:**

* Implement numbered tags or labels on all PJs
* Track asset numbers in CRO database
* Enable inventory management
* Easier identification when moved on-site

* *Benefits:**

* Know which specific units are where
* Track missing units more effectively
* Better inventory control
* Clearer customer charging for missing units

### Opportunity #2: CRO Training & Optimization

* *Comprehensive Training Session:**

* Schedule dedicated time with CRO vendor/training team
* Review all system capabilities
* Identify underutilized features
* Address known issues and misuse patterns

* *Route Optimization Improvement:**

* Understand if routing constraints can be improved
* Explore if there's a better workflow for optimization
* May need different approach or additional CRO modules

### Opportunity #3: Moved Unit Protocol

* *Customer Communication:**

* Policy on moving porta-johns
* Notify company if unit needs to be relocated
* Placement guidelines to minimize moves

* *Onsite Documentation:**

* GPS coordinates or placement photos when delivered
* Reference points for service crews
* Update CRO when units are moved

### Opportunity #4: Email Confirmation Process

* *Similar to Other Services:**

* Most other services require email approval for billing protection
* Consider implementing email confirmation for PJ orders
* Protects against disputes and non-payment

## SYSTEMS & TOOLS

### CRO Software

* *Current Use:**

* Order entry and tracking
* Route assignment and optimization
* Schedule management
* Customer and site information database

* *Limitations:**

* Can only optimize routes after assignment
* Issues occurring without clear root cause
* Not being used to full potential

* *Needed:**

* Training session with vendor
* Root cause analysis of recurring issues
* Feature exploration for better utilization

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

### Positive Observations

* Things going well overall with Stephen
* System is functional for day-to-day operations
* Stephen collecting comprehensive customer information
* Similar operational model to other service directors (Wendy, Kerin)

### Areas for Improvement

1. Asset tracking and unit identification
2. Route optimization workflow
3. CRO software training and full utilization
4. Addressing software issues proactively vs. firefighting
5. Policy on moved units and customer communication

## NOTABLE QUOTES

### On Asset Tracking

> "None of the PJs are tagged/labeled or asset numbered in any way"
> "Most of the time we come onsite the PJs are moved"

### On Route Optimization

> "The hardest part of the job is routing. A lot of the routes need adjusting and optimizing. You can only optimize after assigning and you need to optimize often."

### On CRO Software

> "The CRO software isn't being used to its full potential AND it's being misused or having issues from time to time and we don't know why. We really need to sit down with the training people and figure out what is happening and fix instead of just firefighting."

## CONCLUSION

Stephen runs a functional porta-john operation with clear information requirements and systematic order entry. His biggest operational challenge is route optimization within CRO's constraints (can only optimize after assignment), requiring constant manual adjustment. The lack of asset tracking creates inefficiencies when units are moved on-site, a common occurrence. The operation would benefit significantly from comprehensive CRO training to unlock full system capabilities and resolve recurring issues proactively rather than reactively. Implementing an asset tagging system would improve inventory control and reduce time spent locating moved units, though ROI should be evaluated first.
