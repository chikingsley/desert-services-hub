## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Wendy Byers operates the roll-off division as a nearly autonomous business unit, having brought 17 years of industry expertise and deep customer relationships to Desert Services four years ago. She personally bids work through BlueBook, quotes pricing, manages all customer relationships, schedules drivers via CRO software, and maintains 90% customer loyalty through exceptional 24/7 personal service. Working remotely from Show Low, Wendy relies on direct phone and text communication with contractors, preferring to bypass the central answering service that causes delays and errors. She implemented CRO when joining (replacing Excel chaos), though prefers Box Tracker from previous roles for its superior error handling. Currently operating at full capacity with drivers running 6-9 routes daily, the division faces equipment constraints (running out of cans) during an unusually busy November. Her impending December retirement presents significant knowledge transfer challenges: undocumented distance-based pricing formulas, personal customer relationships built over decades, industry expertise in negotiating overage fees, and operational best practices exist only in her head.

## WORK INTAKE & FLOW

### Sources of Work

* *1. Existing Customer Base (90% of business)**

* Personal relationships built over 39 years
* Customers call/text Wendy directly
* Repeat business and referrals
* "My customers have followed me from day one"
* Strong loyalty: "Some of 'em are freaking out that I'm leaving"

* *2. BBBid.TheBlueBook.com (Proactive Bidding)**

* Online bidding platform (company pays subscription)
* Access: Don, Mike, Rick, Jeff Gardner, Mike Lanning, Wendy
* Wendy personally monitors and bids on opportunities
* Dawn uses it for pre-qualifications

* *Bidding Process:**

1. Jobs post on BlueBook
2. Wendy reviews opportunities
3. Can bid through platform OR
4. Extract email and contact directly (gets better response)
5. Send commercial pricing sheet
6. Reference specific job from BlueBook posting
7. Follow up

* *Why Direct Email Works Better:**

> "Blue Book I mean they'll send you yeah this job was bidded or this was awarded but I get more when I do both ways. They're more apt to respond to their own email than Blue Book."

* *3. Sales Team Referrals (Minimal)**

* Lacie and others occasionally send leads
* Wendy prefers customers call her directly
* Reason: Sales often missing critical information
* "Whatever they send me, I have to call the contractor anyway"
* Better turnaround when contractor calls direct: "There's a better chance of them getting it the next day"

* *4. Central Answering Service (Problematic)**

* Direct line routes to answering service
* Service takes messages and emails Wendy
* Frequent issues: Wrong phone numbers, incorrect information
* Wendy must call contractor back anyway
* "Yesterday I had a wrong phone number. Last week I had a wrong phone number."
* Customers frustrated: "Our answering service is terrible"

### Pricing Strategy

* *Commercial Pricing:**

* Standard pricing sheet for metro Phoenix area
* Additional distance fees for outlying areas

  * Carefree, Surprise, Casa Grande: +$100
  * Other distant areas: +$125
  * "That's something I need to tell my successor"
  * Formula undocumented: "I just go, oh, distance, I'm gonna charge you a hundred bucks more"

* *Overage Fees (Industry Standard):**

* 21 days included in rental
* $20/day after 21 days
* Recently reduced from 30 days to 21
* Industry trend: Many competitors at 14 days
* Proactive management: Weekly calls to customers approaching limit
* "Those are our assets. You can't keep them permanently. We need them. That's how we make our money."

* *Sales Team Concerns:**

* Michael and Lacie report losing business due to overage fees
* Competitors (Weinberger, others) don't charge overage
* Wendy's perspective: "It is nowadays, yes, everybody's doing it"
* Sales team lacks context/scripts to defend policy

## OPERATIONS & CAPACITY

### Current Capacity Status

* *At Maximum Capacity (Unusual for November):**

* Normally slows down November-December (holidays)
* Currently "slammed" with work
* Drivers running 6-9 routes daily
* Example day: One driver has 9 runs (4 in Casa Grande)
* Working to minimize overtime while meeting demand

* *Equipment Constraints:**

* Running out of available cans/dumpsters
* Just ordered two 30-yard cans
* One immediately allocated to new permanent customer
* Hesitant to order more before slow season
* Risk: Landfills demand removal of excess stored cans
* "We're almost out of cans right now"

* *Driver Capacity:**

* Target: 6 runs per day per driver
* Current: Up to 9 runs in heavy periods
* Varies by area and distance
* Route planning keeps drivers "tight as possible"
* Example efficiency: Driver completed 5 runs by noon, heading to Casa Grande for final 3

* *Recent Staffing:**

* One driver left recently
* New driver starting Monday
* Full-timer returning from vacation Monday
* Seeking part-time driver for additional capacity
* All candidates now processed through HR (drug testing, etc.)

### CRO Software (Operations Platform)

* *Implemented by Wendy (4 years ago):**

> "They didn't have a database. And I said, you guys, you cannot be doing all this shit on an Excel spreadsheet. It's a mess. So we got the database then."

* *Current Usage:**

* Order entry and tracking
* Driver scheduling and routing
* Calendar view with daily run counts
* Automated recurring pickups (e.g., "every Monday, every Friday")
* PO numbers and job names stored in system
* Direct integration with billing (Kerin pulls from CRO)

* *Comparison to Previous Systems:**

* *Box Tracker (Preferred):**

* Better error handling: Won't allow wrong can numbers
* Prevents duplicate cans on site
* Superior mapping and scheduling interface
* "I liked it better, but to try and change things around, that's a lot for a company this big"

* *CRO Issues:**

* Allows incorrect can number entry
* Driver with dyslexia struggles with data entry
* Results in duplicate cans at sites
* Wendy must locate and fix numbering issues
* "They shouldn't let you put in a wrong number when it's an exchange"

* *Why Not Switch:**

* Company already invested in CRO
* Team trained and adapted
* Too disruptive to change now
* "We're used to this now"

### Route Planning & Scheduling

* *Territory Assignment:**

* Each driver assigned specific geographic areas
* Maintains consistent customer relationships
* Optimizes route efficiency

* *Daily Operations:**

* Wendy schedules using CRO calendar
* Can see all runs by date
* Target: Drivers done by 1-2 PM (minimize overtime)
* Current reality: Running longer due to capacity constraints
* Example: Driver started 5 AM, will finish Casa Grande runs by day's end

* *Recurring Services:**

* CRO allows automatic scheduling
* Set frequency (every Monday, every Friday, etc.)
* System automatically generates pickup schedule
* Reduces manual scheduling work

## INTAKE TO EXECUTION PROCESS

### Step 1: Order Intake

* *Preferred Method: Direct Call/Text**

* Customer calls or texts Wendy directly
* Most orders: "I need this container flipped tomorrow"
* Immediate verbal confirmation: "You got it, be done tomorrow"
* Trust-based, no email confirmation needed
* "Out of all my customers database I bet you I got three people that emailed for orders, the rest of them call me or text me"

* *Information Collected:**

1. Size of dumpster (10, 20, 30, 40 yard)
2. Location/address
3. Type: Exchange, termination, or delivery
4. Placement (for new deliveries)
5. Project manager phone number
6. PO number or job name (if applicable)

### Step 2: Entry into CRO

* *Immediate Data Entry:**

* All order information entered in CRO database
* Includes customer contact (PM phone)
* PO number or job name
* Service type and location
* Date/frequency if recurring

* *Scheduling:**

* Assign to appropriate driver based on territory
* Consider driver capacity (target 6 runs/day)
* Account for distance (Casa Grande adds significant time)
* Balance routes to minimize overtime

### Step 3: Driver Execution

* *Driver Access:**

* Drivers see scheduled runs in CRO
* Mobile access from trucks
* Update status as runs complete
* Input can numbers (error-prone in current system)

* *Common Issue:**

* Driver inputs wrong can number during exchange
* CRO doesn't validate/reject
* Results in duplicate cans at site or missing cans
* Wendy must troubleshoot and correct
* "We have duplicate cans sitting out there because of this reason"

### Step 4: Billing

* *Automatic Process:**

* Kerin pulls data directly from CRO
* No additional input needed from Wendy
* First company where Wendy hasn't managed QuickBooks
* "She just does the bill. She has since I started there."

* *Overage Tracking:**

* CRO generates report of cans over 21 days
* Wendy reviews weekly
* Proactive calls to customers: "Hey, you're at this many days, you know"
* Mixed reception: "Some of 'em have a fit"
* Educational approach: "Those are assets. You can't keep them permanently"

## CHALLENGES & PAIN POINTS

### Challenge #1: Answering Service Issues

* *The Problem:**

> "In fact I got a text from somebody the other day that said our answering service is terrible."

* *Specific Issues:**

* Direct line routes to answering service instead of Wendy's phone
* Frequent wrong phone numbers in messages
* Missing or incomplete information
* Customers don't know if order was taken or confirmed
* Wendy must call back anyway

* *Desired State:**

* Calls ring directly to work phone first
* If no answer, THEN route to answering service
* "It should ring and then if it doesn't answer, go to the answering service"

* *Impact on Business:**

* Wendy recently price-shopped answering services
* Found competitor that wouldn't provide pricing until callback
* "That right there turns me off. I'm gonna keep calling somebody else till I get a price."
* Recognizes same frustration in her own customers

### Challenge #2: Sales Team Communication Gap

* *Missing Information from Sales:**

* Sales team occasionally sends leads
* Often missing: Address, placement, PM contact, urgency
* "I don't have where it's gonna be placed. I don't have... information I need"
* Forces Wendy to call contractor anyway
* Delays response time

* *Customer Preference:**

> "If they call me directly there's a better chance of them getting it the next day."

* *Sales Team Disconnect:**

* Never had formal meeting with sales team
* Sales unaware of pricing rationale (overage fees)
* Sales report losing business, Wendy confirms fees are industry standard
* Lack of shared talking points/scripts
* Sales positioned as problem vs. Wendy positioned as solution

### Challenge #3: CRO System Limitations

* *Data Entry Errors:**

* System allows incorrect can numbers during exchanges
* One driver with dyslexia particularly affected
* Results in operational chaos: Duplicate cans at sites, lost cans
* Manual cleanup required

* *Comparison to Box Tracker:**

* Box Tracker threw error messages for wrong numbers
* Forced correct data entry
* Better mapping and scheduling interface
* "I liked it better"

* *Why It Matters:**

* Cans are critical assets (currently running out)
* Tracking accuracy essential for capacity management
* Time wasted locating and correcting errors
* "When somebody's out there we need to change the numbers and all"

### Challenge #4: Capacity & Equipment Constraints

* *Current State:**

* At maximum capacity (unusual for November)
* Running out of available cans
* Drivers requesting more 40-yard units
* "Bear with me. I'll get one from somebody else, you know, a termination."

* *Seasonal Dilemma:**

* Need cans now (high demand)
* Slow season coming (December-January)
* Don't want excess cans sitting at landfills
* Landfills pressure to remove stored equipment
* "I don't want them sitting at all the landfills and then the landfills go, you gotta get the cans out of here"

* *2025 Outlook:**

* Will probably need to order more cans next year
* Just ordered two 30-yarders (one already committed)
* New contractor keeping permanent 30-yard on site for year

### Challenge #5: Knowledge Transfer for Succession

* *Undocumented Tribal Knowledge:**

* *Distance-Based Pricing:**

* Wendy adds fees based on distance: $100-125
* Formula in her head only
* "That's something I need to tell my successor"
* No written guidelines on which areas get which fees

* *Customer Relationships:**

* 39 years of industry relationships
* Personal rapport: Customers recognize her voice
* 90% customer retention based on personal service
* "Some of 'em are freaking out that I'm leaving"
* Not transferable: "I mean some of 'em are freaking out that I'm leaving. And I'm like, look, I promise whoever takes over, I mean I pray it... I pray they'll be the same as me."

* *Operational Best Practices:**

* Route optimization strategies
* Capacity planning approaches
* Overage fee negotiation tactics
* Customer service philosophies
* Weekly proactive calling (overage management)

* *Timeline Pressure:**

* Retiring end of December (2 months)
* No successor identified yet
* Glenn (assistant director) just started learning roles
* Wendy will visit office in November
* Limited overlap time

### Challenge #6: Remote Work & Phone Situation

* *Personal Phone Dependency:**

* Used personal phone for 4 years
* Just received work phone 3 weeks ago
* Still using personal as primary
* Customers have personal number
* Transferring contacts in progress

* *Previous Experience:**

* Prior employer paid phone bill but kept number when she left
* "It pissed me off. So never again."
* Hesitant to fully commit to work phone

* *Work/Life Balance:**

* 24/7 availability for 4 years
* Never taken vacation or sick day: "I've been here, I've never taken vacation or a sick day"
* Retiring after 39 years: "That's why I'm ready to retire"
* Model may not be sustainable for successor

## OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT

### Opportunity #1: Direct Phone Routing

* *Current State:** Calls → Answering service → Email → Wendy callback

* *Desired State:** Calls → Wendy's work phone → Voicemail/Answering service

* *Implementation:**

* Configure work phone as primary for container direct line
* Answering service as backup only
* Test with new work phone for successor
* Measure: Reduction in callback volume, improved response time

* *Benefits:**

* Faster customer response (next-day turnaround)
* Reduced frustration for customers
* Fewer wrong numbers and missing information
* Professional customer experience

### Opportunity #2: Sales Team Integration

* *Missing Connection:**

* Sales team and Wendy never had formal meeting
* Sales losing business due to overage fees (perception: problem)
* Wendy confirms fees are industry standard (reality: necessary)
* No shared talking points or positioning

* *Recommended Actions:**

1. Monthly coordination meeting (Sales + Wendy + successor)
2. Document pricing rationale and competitive positioning
3. Create talking points for overage fee conversation
4. Share customer feedback (positive and negative)
5. Collaborative approach to lost business (win-back strategies)

* *Example Script for Sales:**

> "Industry standard is moving to 14-day overage periods. We offer 21 days, which gives you more flexibility. After that, we charge $20/day because these are valuable assets we need to turn for other customers. Most GCs plan their timelines to avoid overage fees, and we're happy to work with you on scheduling to minimize any charges."

### Opportunity #3: CRO System Enhancement

* *Immediate Fix:**

* Request validation rules from CRO vendor
* Prevent invalid can number entry
* Implement error messages similar to Box Tracker

* *Longer-Term Consideration:**

* Evaluate Box Tracker for company-wide roll-out
* Compare features, pricing, integration capabilities
* May be better fit than CRO for roll-off operations
* Consider if Kerin (PJs) would also benefit

* *Training:**

* Additional training for driver with dyslexia
* Visual guides or checklists
* Double-check protocols for exchanges
* Supervisor review of data entry accuracy

### Opportunity #4: Knowledge Transfer & Documentation

* *Critical Priority (2 months remaining):**

* *Document Pricing:**

* Commercial pricing sheet (formalize)
* Distance fee matrix (which areas, what amounts)
* Competitive positioning (overage fees, turn time, service level)
* When to negotiate vs. hold firm

* *Create Succession Plan:**

* BlueBook bidding process and best practices
* Email follow-up templates
* Customer communication philosophy
* Weekly overage management routine
* Route planning principles
* Capacity monitoring techniques
* Equipment ordering guidelines (seasonal considerations)

* *Customer Introduction Plan:**

* Wendy introduces successor personally
* Joint calls during November overlap
* Email to customer base announcing transition
* Emphasize continuity of service quality

* *Shadowing/Overlap:**

* Successor should start ASAP (not wait until December)
* Minimum 4 weeks overlap recommended
* Wendy available for questions post-retirement (temporary)

### Opportunity #5: Sustainable Work Model

* *Current Model (Not Sustainable):**

* 24/7 availability
* Personal phone for 4 years
* Never taken vacation or sick day
* Single person with no dependents

* *Successor Considerations:**

* May have family/life commitments
* Need backup coverage for vacation/sick days
* Consider Glenn (assistant director) as backup
* Define reasonable availability hours
* Emergency escalation process for after-hours

* *Recommendations:**

* Work phone with voicemail for after-hours
* Answering service for true emergencies only
* Customer expectation-setting (response times)
* Cross-training for backup coverage

### Opportunity #6: Capacity Planning & Forecasting

* *Current Approach:**

* Reactive: Order cans when running out
* Seasonal intuition (slow December-January)
* Constraint: Landfill storage limitations

* *Improvement Opportunities:**

* Use CRO data to forecast equipment needs
* Track can utilization rates by season
* Identify equipment ROI thresholds
* Coordinate with sales on pipeline (upcoming large customers)
* Consider can rental vs. purchase for peak periods

* *Example:**

* New contractor keeping permanent 30-yard all year
* Could have been anticipated from sales pipeline
* Earlier procurement could have avoided current shortage

* Competitors: Weinberger and others no longer charging (sales team report)
* Wendy's view: "Everybody's doing it... You need to because... you give 'em thirty days, they're keeping those cans for thirty days"

* *Pricing Pressure:**

* Sales team reports losing roll-off business
* Michael: "Main pain point" is overage fees, not base pricing
* Lacie lost roll-off portion of large PJ contract
* Disconnect: Sales vs. Wendy on market reality

### Wendy's Competitive Advantage

* *Personal Service:**

* 24/7 availability
* Personal relationships built over 39 years
* Customers know her voice, trust her expertise
* Proactive communication (weekly overage calls)
* Fast response (next-day turnaround for direct calls)

* *Industry Expertise:**

* 17 years roll-off specific
* 39 years total construction services
* Knows pricing strategies, fee justification
* Route optimization and capacity management
* Equipment needs and seasonal patterns

* *Customer Loyalty:**

* 90% of customers followed her from previous employers
* "Some of 'em are freaking out that I'm leaving"
* Based on service quality, not price
* Vulnerable to churn post-retirement

## ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

### Historical Background

* *Industry Experience:**

* Various roll-off companies: 17 years (including Desert Services)
* Total: 39 years in construction services
* Retiring: End of December 2024

* *Joining Desert Services (4 years ago):**

* Jayson previously managed roll-offs
* Wendy took over roll-off division
* Brought customer base with her (90% followed)
* Implemented CRO software (replaced Excel chaos)
* Tim's direction: "You know what you're doing, just keep running it"
* Operated autonomously since day one

### Current Leadership & Relationships

* *Reports to Tim (owner/CEO):**

* High trust, given full autonomy
* Recent discussions about succession and work phone
* Monthly visit to office (November upcoming)

* *Coordinates with:**

* Kerin: Billing (pulls from CRO, no interaction needed)
* HR (Tanya): Driver candidates, drug testing
* Sales team (Lacie, etc.): Occasional leads (minimal)
* Glenn: New assistant director learning roles

* *Independent Operations:**

* No sales team support (never had at any company)
* Self-directed bidding and pricing
* Hiring and managing own drivers
* Customer service and relationship management
* Essentially runs as separate business unit within company

### Company Integration Level

* *Minimal Integration:**

* Works remotely (3 hours away)
* Never met with sales team formally
* Rarely visits office
* Operates independently via CRO and phone
* Kerin handles billing without Wendy involvement

* *This Works Because:**

* Wendy's expertise and autonomy
* CRO system provides needed structure
* Customer base is personal (not company-driven)
* Tim's management philosophy (hands-off for performers)

* *Risk for Company:**

* Single point of failure
* Knowledge primarily tribal
* Customer relationships personal, not institutional
* Succession challenge acute

### On System Implementation

> "They didn't have a database. And I said, you guys, you cannot be doing all this shit on an Excel spreadsheet. It's a mess. So we got the database then."

### On Box Tracker vs. CRO

> "I liked it [Box Tracker] better, but to try and change things around, that's a lot for a company this big. So no, it's fine."

### On Answering Service

### On Direct Customer Contact

### On Asset Management (Overage Fees)

> "Those are our assets. You can't keep them permanently. We need them. That's how we make our money. It's turning our cans."

### On Capacity Constraints

## CONCLUSION

Wendy Byers has built a highly effective, customer-centric roll-off operation based on personal relationships, industry expertise, and extreme availability—but this model is entirely dependent on her and largely undocumented. With only two months until retirement, the company faces significant succession risk: 90% customer loyalty is tied to Wendy personally, pricing formulas exist only in her head, and her 24/7 service model is unsustainable for most successors. The immediate priority is aggressive knowledge transfer during November, including documentation of pricing strategies, customer relationship best practices, and operational workflows. Success requires not just hiring a replacement, but reimagining the role for sustainable work-life balance while preserving service quality. The answering service issues and sales team disconnect represent quick wins that could ease the transition and improve customer experience regardless of who manages the division.
