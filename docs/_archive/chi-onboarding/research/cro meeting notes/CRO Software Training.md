And there's people that basically have, what's it called? People that have, we have what we call delivery managers or directors for every you saw. We have seven different service lines. Technically it's kind of like 5 because we have 5 service directors, but they will get calls directly.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
During the day, hey, I need a portable toilet. Hey, I need a trash and I need to roll off trash can. I need a new sign. So we have like these two kind of sources that, you know, come in and then there's like.

James Jackson
Mhm.

Chi Ejimofor
That those are these are the general two big buckets depending now for the how it gets scheduled. I mean this is the that's one of the things it depends on the service. You know this is like we is this business has been around for 20 years started with like 1 water truck and they just built from there buying up businesses so.

James Jackson
Mhm.

Chi Ejimofor
These service families historically, you know, before the last year, before the company was purchased, these like almost operated as their own like siloed businesses. And as it's been purchased, like the whole idea is kind of bring it together and have a cohesive kind of not necessarily.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
The ideal, the ideal would be like a cohesive execution, you know, because maybe, maybe, possibly everybody's working out of the same thing or something where as a project coordinator, as a project manager, somebody is able to direct the work to where it needs to go and so it can be executed on and we keep track of it.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Yeah.

James Jackson
There.

Amber will indicate these jobs that are due soon, so these are up and coming visits. We also have blue that'll indicate the guys are actually in progress, so they're in the middle of doing a particular job and yellow will indicate that the guys are actually on route to the job, so in the middle of driving to the the the particular property.

Each line represents its own individual individual visit and if I move across here I have some further job information so I can see the job time when it was booked in for. I can see the type of job. So was it a maintenance, was it you know PPM, was it a reactive, was it a project install etcetera. So what we would love to do.

Is replicate the terminology that you guys use and I suppose the job types that you use would do and you can come in here and filter by these. So if you want to see you know all of your per jobs versus the maybe likes of your, you know your survey jobs, you have the ability to see this.

You can also come in here and filter by your individual users. So if you maybe want to see for a particular engineer, maybe I want to see Craig and Harry's jobs over this period. I have the ability to see this. You can also filter by job reference, customer reference. You can filter by individual customers as well. So if you want to see all jobs based on.

You know, particular customer, you can filter by address, by form. So that's the paperwork or the digitized paperwork that the guys will be filling in whenever they're out in the field. Your view button is quite popular when it comes to the likes of the processing of a job. So this is where you can either choose to create an invoice or send a copy of the job sheet to your customer.

Your report column is where you can send a copy of the job sheet to your customer via e-mail. Now I'll touch on that once we have completed a job later on in the demonstration. Your status column. Again, really, really important. This will indicate the statuses of your particular jobs and you can't filter by these, so if you want to see all jobs that are incomplete.

Versus jobs maybe that have been completed and jobs that have been invoiced or processed. You know the terminology that can change and you can put multiple statuses in here. It doesn't need to be done on an individual basis. You also then have your priority column and then you can also request signatures. So signatures can be obtained within the guy's devices.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Jackson
Whenever they're out doing jobs, this comes into play if maybe the guys forget to get a signature from or whoever they need to get a signature from, maybe left early or they just weren't on site.

Yeah.

James Jackson
Whenever they're out doing jobs, this comes into play if maybe the guys forget to get a signature from or whoever they need to get a signature from, maybe left early or they just weren't on site.

So these are just custom tabs as such, and these can be taken away. If they're not applicable, we get rid of them. But this is just some type people like to hold accounts information. This can be called anything really. They're all customizable. In this case it's just called accounts.

Chi Ejimofor
OK, Yep.

Yeah.

OK. And you could add. So I mean if I want, I mean what would you do like if there was a, yeah, if we're like, hey, I want project, I want that to be a list of projects or I want to be a list of jobs, would you, is that something you would put there or is it more specific to?

James Jackson
No. So the the the list of the jobs would appear within here, so that it will be in in its own section.

Chi Ejimofor
OK. And then you'd and then you'd filter that by the customer and then you'd see all the list of stuff by, yeah, yeah.

James Jackson
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah. Or you could filter by, um, you yeah, by by user, different things like that, just using all the filters along the top.

Chi Ejimofor
Or by user, yeah.

OK.

And then on a job you can, depending on M and J contractors, we have, let's say we have 20 contacts, you create a new job, you're able to, you know, depending on the project or whatever, you're able to choose the contact that's relevant to that job.

James Jackson
Um.

Chi Ejimofor
Or is it? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Can you like assign? Yeah, or.

.

James Jackson
Yeah, is that the like the contact who you're gonna be speaking with in within Google for example or?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. For example, cause like there's a different, there'll be a different contact for every, let's say it's contract, there'll be a different or for for every contract there would be a different contact. It's not a main, there might be a main, but it's more.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Like contract by contract.

James Jackson
Yeah, it could be done. Now it wouldn't be like whenever you're creating the customer, it'll automatically pull in on the guy's device your main point of contact. Now what you can do is when choosing the form, you may have an option within here. For example, if I choose something here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Jackson
Uh, none of these are giving me what I want, but this could be called, you know, main point of contact and then you may choose from a drop down or you can manually type in. So the guys will be able to see that on their job sheet. It's not ideal, but that that's the way we would we would do that because you can't overwrite essentially your main point of contact against said customer.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Yeah, OK.

James Jackson
That makes sense.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, makes sense.

James Jackson
You do also have the option, but again, you might be creating a lot of them. You can create different sites for that particular customer. So you know you may have if we use Google, for example, you may have a Google head office, but you may have, I'm just going to name places in America. You may have like Google, Texas, Google, you know, Seattle within Google, Texas, you may talk to Jordan, within Seattle, you may talk to Claire.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep, Yep.

James Jackson
You know, so you do have the option to do that as well, but if it's multiple people within the one Google head office.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes.
OK.

It would be, yeah. I think it's more of what you just, oh, it's not different cities, but it's different like address. I mean, it's different. It'll be a different address per person, you know, it's a whole different, yeah.

James Jackson
Yeah, yeah. In that case, then sites would be perfect for that. That would work exactly the way that that you said.

Chi Ejimofor
OK. And that would be under, um, how would that be organized?

James Jackson
So you would have, yeah, so you would have. I don't even know if I have.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, sites. Yeah, that's perfect. I don't know. Yeah, just organize it by sites. That's that's like the perfect.

James Jackson
Yeah, so you would have like your Google, which would be your main point of contact, and then if there's any sites linked against that, they would all appear within here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, it's perfect. And then so, yeah, you just so it'd be Google and then you'd assign the site and then I'll be it. Yeah, that's easy. Yeah, this is, yeah, this is sick.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I like it. No. Yeah, that's good. That's, I was gonna say, yeah, all the, I mean, that's all, that's all everybody has, like has all the stuff that, you know, I've talked to all the people has all the seems like it has all the things.

James Jackson
Is that what you're expecting to see today with all the functionalities and?

Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, maybe like to check, like, I don't know the driving around or something, but other than yeah, I have a meeting in like 2 couple minutes. Probably gotta, I'll be late. But yeah, I guess what are the next steps?

James Jackson
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
You know, I guess I know I heard, I guess you have route planning. It sounds like it's a separate line item. So I don't know how you guys price things as well, but yeah, what are you guys's next things?

James Jackson
Yeah, well, I suppose with regards to that, I suppose you go off, have a chat with other people, see if you think the system's gonna be a fit from that. You know, we can do another demo. That side's no problem. With regards to costing, I suppose you just let us know roughly how many guys would need access to the system, both in the office.

On out in the field and then I'll be able to send you off over pricing just once we get off the call.

Chi Ejimofor
OK. So you yeah, if you can e-mail me those couple questions, I'll try to, I mean I'll get get it back to you. I'll give you a range as well if you if there's a range, I'm sure it's a per user range. I don't know if you guys have. OK, OK. Wow. Thank you guys for your time. This is.

James Jackson
Yeah, no problem. Yeah, that's OK.

Yeah, it is, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, it's this works. It seems like, yeah, it works. And yeah, it works some.

James Jackson
If the decision, if it was down to you today, would you say yes? If we, if everybody else, if you had to totally make the decision, do you think we've showed you enough today to to go ahead?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, it would be enough to trial, you know, for. Yeah. Well, again, because like every again, we these people working on like this paper and pencil, you know, so it's like, you know, so it's like a but trial. Yes. Yeah. It's enough for the CEO. He would, he would be like, OK, like let's.

James Jackson
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
You know, if I told him to, he would say, yeah, fine, let's let's pick a two couple people, yeah.

James Jackson
Yeah, I think we can do as many demos as you want and forms as well. So I think that could be a next part for you. Jordan will send you over the e-mail and with the questions, we'll send you over the demo, a recap of what we discussed and some pricing as well when you get the answers back to us and we can just go from there really and we can set up our next steps from there.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Yeah, just just.

OK, sounds good. All right. See you guys. Oh, well, last small, small, tiny question. I know, I know you guys, you said there's a CRM. I mean, is there like e-mail integrate, like is it pull in stuff, anything like that, like CRM wise, it was more like man, it's like logging the activities.

James Jackson
Yeah. Thank you so much. Cheers. Really good meeting. Have a good day.

Going ahead, yeah.

No.

Yeah, yeah, exactly that. Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
OK. OK. Cool. That was good. All right. Thank you, guys. Have a great rest of the day. Cheers.
