Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, but it's the washing and then you just have like uh You you are are you the main guy for like all the kind of random miscellaneous projects?

Chi Ejimofor
It it was like Yeah, I guess I don't know. I it seems like we have a lot of random stuff that's not even on anything. It's just like hey give us I don't know two weeks. So you're the guy for all miscellaneous stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. WTS.

Daniel Vargas
As far as like water, hookups, stuff like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And you use uh like She's showing me like you send it you like use email or like you have a notepad or something or like a com a notepad that you create we have a uh a sheet of what keeps track of our schedule.

Daniel Vargas
Okay. And we keep putting it and we print it out every like then once or two weeks we'll we'll go back.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you work off do you work off of her schedule or you work out do you have like a uh because I saw the other guy He ha he has like a paper and he'll write everything down and then he'll just take a picture and send it.

Chi Ejimofor
But then I think I saw from you you s you like I don't know if you have a paper and then you write it into an email or what's your process for give to my guys Yeah. Yeah, for how do you do it and then what do you give to them?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
So as of right now, they get the same scheduling. I I can print you off a sheet over here. It gives us all our jobs and then our route hits and it has everyone's schedule. there so they all get a copy of everyone's whole schedule for the week Monday through Friday through Saturday.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And what you is there so is there software that that's used? Okay.

Daniel Vargas
So it's I have been, yeah, I have a guess.

Chi Ejimofor
It's all good. That's all.

Daniel Vargas
That's why I'm like, okay. Morning. How are you doing? Morning, you look good today. How are you? Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, forward to you. Love to introduce you to the case.

Daniel Vargas
Now or late. I mean as we walk through, sure, sure. I guess we would forget
Chi Ejimofor
Good. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Needed woods and dependent face on the spots. I'm the site on the site. So private property. Fleet report, no fish report. So this record.

Daniel Vargas
But I've been handling with Tanya, seeing everything, we make sure that her drug tests are done. I've reached out. We have other companies in the club. I've reached out to them and they reached back out to me.

Daniel Vargas
They want to know super cool guy. Super cool guy. But we don't know how we want to go out. I told him we'll give me a couple of days of time and I'll be getting back up with you, but we'll make sure everything gets set up.

Daniel Vargas
And they've used this for sweeping itself really like control. No, it's the crack in the front rail. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but everything else as far as like finding uh paperwork wife is all those options.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, cool. Uh so I guess I'll just go like piece by piece and then I'll probably be able to. So how does work? Um I'll tell you how I understand it and then you can tell me if I'm correct.

Chi Ejimofor
So work comes into you. It can uh it it comes direct from the customer. It can.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And then it can also come from Within the company and front and that would be from uh from sales.

Daniel Vargas
Sales or Jason.

Chi Ejimofor
Sales or okay, and then
Daniel Vargas
Some people will call Jason because they you know he does all the split work, the road to control, so like they have his contacts, so they'll just call him and he'll give me their information and I will follow it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and so it's either so it's it'll be from Jason specifically, no other uh director or somebody will hit.

Daniel Vargas
Jason and Kelly.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, Jason.

Daniel Vargas
And then the sales people as well.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And just double check.

Daniel Vargas
Kelly does sweeping. Yep. So anytime they do a sweeping they also like people to come with the water shut and wash things. So make it look real quick. So he'll shoot me a text or anything with the information, job name, PO's, and now I can call them and get everything situation.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm sure I'll Okay, and so they they bundle sweeping and cleaning. Yeah. Okay, so it comes from one of the managers or direct from customer from sales.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then uh if it's from a a customer or It sounds like from talking to Don that some of the work is scheduled and some of the work is, or not scheduled, some of the work is on con tracked and some of the work is invoiced Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Um and on contract to me is like probably from Jason.

Daniel Vargas
No, um on contract is usually from sales. Okay. Um just because the on contract ones are kind of like the guys that are gonna go for like full eight hour days. You know, yeah, or they they want it, you know, twice a day, two two hits a day or on Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, all the different officers the offer.

Daniel Vargas
So that's when they go off contract. Okay. The invoices are usually like the guys that call in that want like cleaning this weekend. They call me on a Wednesday like hey Saturday I need a clean in. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Okay. Hey, you know I'll be there.

Chi Ejimofor
I'll put things good. What yeah, what percent do you think is is like is that recur like you know you already know versus like kind of people just calling in and you you're like percentage versus Yeah, just it doesn't have to be exact, but just kind of like rough.

Daniel Vargas
So uh it's it's got like about a sixty-four
Chi Ejimofor
And 60 is the contracting.

Daniel Vargas
And then the 40 is about the invoice. Right now, because we have more on-site truck drivers than we ever have in the services. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So more on site than ever. That's clutch.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, so regardless, uh I guess does the does how what you do with the whatever it is Does it change depending on who you get the information from or is your it's like basic okay so then that's that takes out half the question.

Chi Ejimofor
So you get a somebody sales hits you up, customer hits you up, what's what do you do with that? information.

Daniel Vargas
What do you think? I instantly so they send me over their contact. So my first initial thing is to call them and get in contact, voice to voice, set up a scheduling for me to either walk the site or then to send me pictures so I can take an estimate on the whole project.

Chi Ejimofor
So you'll do an you'll do an estimate.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Yeah, I'll go walk this job side, see how many man hours it's gonna take, how many trucks it's gonna take, and just total how many days.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay. And then just for when you go to the site, what do you what are you looking at? You're just looking at the area? Yeah, what are you looking at?

Daniel Vargas
I'm looking at the parking lot. So if it's so if it's Cleanup I'm looking at how dirty it is how much dirt we're actually is gonna come up when we start pushing it because when we start washing it might look like oh it's not that bad but then you get this silt lifted up from the asphalt and it's like this thick and we just push in mud consistently all day so you want to take granted for that because that's going to take in more time.

Daniel Vargas
Um and then for dust control jobs I'm I'm looking to see how The ground is taking the water. Like the speed. How much is it seeping into the how fast is it seeping into the ground?

Daniel Vargas
Like is my guy gonna be running out here Egg moving every 15, 20 minutes spraying or is he gonna have some downtime like you know, take thirty minutes wait, especially as it gets colder. Ground takes up less water, you know what I mean, so it stays wet longer.

Daniel Vargas
So I I try to take all these variables into Because I need to know when I'm looking at my GPSs, if my guy's on an eight hour project and I notice he's idling for an hour or something, is he messing up?

Daniel Vargas
Is he just out there messing around or is he you know waiting on his downtime to work a job side downtime? Again too.

Chi Ejimofor
So you'll like pour water onto the ground or something?

Daniel Vargas
And wet the ground down, wet the dirt down?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
And actually wait and sit there and watch the see how long it takes to actually touch.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah so you guys will physically okay. So like literally the dust control is spraying it, watching it, dry dry. And then if you have to you might have to do like one or two passes or something like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Shoot. That's cool. I I yeah, I read the desk permit thing and I was like He said that everybody kinda does the same thing but I was wondering like Does that mean everybody doesn't do it or but it's like no people literally it's just a default thing you just go out there and spray the ground.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah and that's just easy. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And you also have a have a 310 dust card just be able to operate a water truck together and uh know the proper way to spray water.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. So that's cleaning dust. Okay, and so water so desk water trucks are for dust control.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah dust control and like
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Because you use them you can use them for both, but so when people just if people just casually refer to like water truck They could be referring to dust they're probably referring to dust control.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool.

Daniel Vargas
We do get a lot of business on the cleanup, so I don't get a Saturday off because we really we get them. Every side of it.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's and that's generally uh that's generally the pressure washing cleaning. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
It's not like the final clean.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Project's done and you just want the parking lot and everything to look
Chi Ejimofor
When I read that first I was like, I don't know if we have like uh tiny ladies going in there and washing walls, but it's it's not that it's like it's on the parking lots, it's with the trucks, okay.

Daniel Vargas
And then we got the pressure washing trucks. like I said we will go up and in reach like some power wash you know big old tall buildings three story buildings and that's the wall the windows walls yeah okay uh the outside walls
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, we don't do much of in interior anymore. We used to back then. Yeah. But it was cleaning was its own division back then. I didn't manage it.

Daniel Vargas
I'm like water. trucks and cleaning was its own division. Pressure washing site cleaning up was its own division. So they had a bigger labor crew to be able to handle all those jobs. So right now we don't take on a lot of those jobs.

Chi Ejimofor
contract those out to um um precision cleaning okay so we will get those in but we sub we sub them out and that's one of your like miscellaneous yeah miscellaneous Come up or is it like enough like once a month?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. If it's a bigger pressure washing job, like actual with like an actual pressure washing wand and stuff, we'll subcontract those out because I don't have the manpower to actually take on those jobs.

Daniel Vargas
Um, so maybe I maybe once or twice a month. I would say that for a while, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, so depend and you said for the larger pressure washing jobs um you can so that's that will be so you'll go out, you'll look at it, and then you'll kind of determine whether we want to take on the job or stop contract.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you'll do an estimate and that and then at that point you'll you know internal versus you know subcontract.

Daniel Vargas
I don't even call them precision cleaning, I'll call them, give them my details like how many hours the square footage because they actually charge per square footage. I'll further clean it. So I'll call them, give them all the information, they'll send me a quote and we'll add 20% on top of it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep Okay.

Daniel Vargas
The whole time we use them, I'm still the point of contact for those job sites. Like I'll go out there and meet that company there, talk to the superintendent, get these guys started on everything.

Chi Ejimofor
And when you determine like internal versus external uh intern internal versus external, you're looking at your uh How do you know I guess the capacity that you have?

Daniel Vargas
Is it like just you just are aware of like a one-day project or two-day project? Depending, I'll I'll look at my scheduling to see what kind of free time I have and availability in my guys.

Daniel Vargas
If I have it, then I can take one of my water chuck drivers. He'll jump in the pressure washing truck and I'll outsource labors from labor systems. and he'll go and do that for his two days. So really if it's more than a three-day project that I passed off.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
If I think it's gonna take more than three days, I'll pass it off. Um under that, I really don't I I think we can manage being able to send out at least once
Chi Ejimofor
form it I would say with two labors and they should be able to And we usually so we'll always drive have the guy driving the water truck and then we'll uh if we do it internal And then if we have the guys, we'll have our own guys do the labor, but if not, then we'll just get a couple from template roots.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Or we'll just outsource the whole thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Temple's for me is honestly what I feel like is killing my profit margin in my vision. Okay. Um because back in the day I never used tempers Like we are all from SWIP crew, yeah, was the lot lot wash cleaning labors.

Daniel Vargas
Like that's how they got that overtime. We planned them on Saturdays, these guys would come in and help me every Saturday or help the old director that was here. I worked in Yeah. That's hard to bottom.

Daniel Vargas
So I was there every weekend I was working with him as a hose guy, as a laborer on the side of the hose. But now it seems to be a
Chi Ejimofor
Where SWIP is so flooded with jobs right now they don't Oh so those guys are those guys are busy they don't they're doing overtime or whatever they don't even Yeah they don't even need to help me to get overtime because their overtime is there with all the famous jobs and the soft jobs on Saturday
Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Okay. So I have to like every lot wash I have done in the last uh like half a year has been nothing but 10 weights. And that's from a company you said that um labor systems.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, labor systems.

Daniel Vargas
Which I hate doing because it takes time to keep learning them.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes, okay Let's try. Yeah, I'll try. I'll let you know if I have any issues. No. Yeah, I don't know if it'll let you have like B in the two.

Chi Ejimofor
simultaneously so oh is it the same like license thing yeah okay yeah but uh I mean licenses I know them this c cost I mean it's like six hundred dollars a year
Daniel Vargas
If we need to uh okay. Try to try to get around it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, cool. Uh Uh what do you uh what's the I guess call like I guess the t the uh the the outside is more expensive.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Um do you know I mean off top yeah yeah I think they're charging us Forty dollars an hour for 45 I could pull up an invoice on them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah, well what uh so you don't have a good you just pull up uh you just when you do you use a computer ever I haven't got anyone.

Daniel Vargas
My laptop have been asking for a tablet or a laptop because how I do my work completes is all off this work phone here. So like this is the 14th, right? These are all my guys' day all their jobs, whether they did it, when they did it.

Daniel Vargas
Like I keep having to have to do it.

Chi Ejimofor
And this is what you like basically copy and send. I saw that as an email.

Daniel Vargas
Yep. Dang. So this is going back for years.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah wow. Yeah. Years. Yeah, years. And just in the phone. Okay. Yeah, just in the phone. Well that'll be easy enough to uh well I won't use the word easy, but uh to like migrate since you have all that in the notes file.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean I won't say easy but it's like when I see that I'm like you know we can use some combo yeah automation but it the problem is it's like
Daniel Vargas
I'm so out and about it's like I don't have to be here to use it anyway, you know, with no service.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah yeah, so you you need a little you need like something that you need Like an iPad or tablet that has has a cellular connection would be the best. Something that's like, you know, where it automatically connects to your phone wire.

Daniel Vargas
everything on there so I go to them and they'll type it in for me.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh so versus if I had something I can just so for to complete the S you go and get the information you need to do the estimate but to actually finish the estimate you know the character done. Ah okay
Daniel Vargas
Can't believe both of them called out sick today. No they're fucking playing with each other. Tomorrow you can do it in case right. Yeah, you're gonna nail that right now. Yeah, I know, I'm getting nailed that right now too.

Daniel Vargas
I got to.

Chi Ejimofor
Um Yeah, if you need to go, by the way, just okay.

Daniel Vargas
No, I'm waiting for my guy to get back to the yard anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Oh yeah. So one of them do does the estimate. So you will like just sit with them and just like tell them. I mean it takes them does it how long does it take if you go over and talk to them? Two minutes. Yeah, okay.

Daniel Vargas
You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
They just pull up the sheet and type it.

Chi Ejimofor
I've seen it, yeah, yeah. And then will they send it to They'll send it to me and I'll send it over to the contractor.

Daniel Vargas
Unless Jared, um Jared a lot of the times will send it right over to the con the PM of the general GC to as well and then just CC. Jared likes to be more hands-on in when it comes to money side.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then internally, I mean, what's the like if we I mean even because you said those guys are doing overtime. Oh I mean I can do the math, but I guess it depends on the guys that are on it.

Chi Ejimofor
But these guys, what's like the highest uh guy that the guy the guys getting paid out there? Like twenty-eight to twenty I remember I know I know the there's I heard 20 and 21 for Porter John's and then for the CDL guys 23 is starting and then going up to my highest one of my highest guys
Daniel Vargas
26.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh really? Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And that's just because he's like my right hand man, like my foreman underneath it, right? So if I'm not here, everyone calls him to talk to him Yeah, his name's Chase. Yeah. So he'll go around and and be me through the day.

Chi Ejimofor
And these guys the over t I did do I think I did math once, but so these guys when when you say they do overtime, they're doing like sixty hours or they're doing more like eighty hours or what? Plus 60, okay.

Daniel Vargas
Uh yeah, but there is guys out there that do get the eighty, you know, the one or two or three in the company.

Chi Ejimofor
How many how many um guy oh that's a good um nine. You have nine guys, okay. Nine guys, uh and you Uh for you're selling you uh okay, and you used to pull SWIP guys, but now you can't And so even your nine your nine guys are your are your nine guys getting overtime and stuff already and are your nine guys not a bit not as much as SWIFT.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Um my guys they can on those long long weeks some couple my guys maybe one or two might on a week get like 60 hours but a lot of them are staying around like that 45 or 50

Chi Ejimofor
And is there any reason why those guys do do those guys not want the extra cash or okay, so they just so over time the choice. So okay, so there's they're not as hungry as some of the so just two two types of individuals.

Chi Ejimofor
Um okay.

Daniel Vargas
And I got like one or two guys that are just die hard through sad
Chi Ejimofor
So highest pay is twenty-six, but it's really like and lowest of your guys is twenty-three? Or it goes down. Okay
Daniel Vargas
Okay, okay, so but so in general as right now actually the lowest of my guys they're all in here long enough is 24.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay
Daniel Vargas
But they've all made their ninety days and Okay, so you everybody starts at the twenty-three.

Chi Ejimofor
After ninety days they do the twenty-four. Um Uh they can make a I mean if they do 60 hours.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean they're making you know You're making like uh you know fifteen hundred a week or something, twelve hundred a week. Yeah, yeah. Well I don't know I don't know how they tax uh
Daniel Vargas
I mean when I worked out when I was hourly, I was I'm an hour on the moment I got pushing them 70 hours, you know. And I I had 30 checks.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's for sure. We guys are chilling, okay. Um okay, does it w um and this is like still out of outs outside of the process, does it um does it make financial just looking at your numbers, does it make sense to like bring in labor for that or or or part-time labor for that or is it like it's still under the amount where it's like I would love the way I've looked at it.

Daniel Vargas
is to be able to start another crew for SWIV but designate them to be also my helpers if that makes sense Like when when but on this day I like I can work with Jason on schedule is okay this cruise I got a lot wash Wednesday, Friday or whatever, but the other days you can use them.

Daniel Vargas
Jason, you got them. You know, but these days I got them. Saturday I'm gonna use them. and just like hire these guys coming into the position knowing that they're gonna have to help fill in with both jobs, you know I think that would would be the best bet because then part-time spend off.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
I've hired part-time guys and stuff and they're just not someone for the That's uh Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
It's just uh I mean and any but anybody's looking for work is yeah part-time I don't know. Yeah, okay. So you full time would be good. Do they and they uh I guess you could always can in general people we can always use more guys in general.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's like more guys, it's more about finding and keeping uh but it's not we're not like oh we're like to have too many. It's like that's not a problem. Okay Too many is not a problem.

Chi Ejimofor
It's just just more.

Daniel Vargas
Not as not for laborers. We don't never have enough labor. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And labor, the like hand guys, they are like ride-alongs that basically they go they hit the ride-alongs, I guess. The they go ride alongs are always with SWIP right now.

Chi Ejimofor
Everybody else is like solo drive driving doing the work by themselves. Um so SWIP has How many ride-alongs do they kind of take along?

Daniel Vargas
I mean Well they got four um they're four man crews.

Chi Ejimofor
It's four man crews, okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, four man crews right now.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, okay, so that's they got three.

Daniel Vargas
They got Joel's screw, Jineer's crew, and Justin's screw.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so basically, okay, so you have dri drivers, you don't have any labor directly for yourself. I understand that. Okay. Okay, so you literally have to go to external because unless you ask the SWIGS, they're like, yeah, we're good, but so you have to get or else the job built.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So you have to either just general labor systems or just outsource it completely.

Daniel Vargas
Or talk my guys into running the truck and the hose which getting a CDL driver to do labor work after CDL. Oh boy. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's tough. Uh and what's I mean how what's the difference you know twenty twenty percent plus on on precision versus like what's I mean a range I mean So we like 20% margins on the precision.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you have any clue what margins are on like the the like Truck plus labor system? No, but I can um it's higher though.

Chi Ejimofor
It's higher. Okay. Yeah. And then of course truck plus our guys is like the best uh yeah Yeah that's I mean yeah that's where we're gonna make most Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So you schedule, okay, and this is for uh okay, so that's for you schedule so you you you'll site walk the site and this is for um Okay, so for cleaning and you'll do the estimate and then you'll determine internal versus external, but for uh dust, it's all internal.

Chi Ejimofor
All internal. Dust is all internal. All internal. Okay. So after um uh after you get uh estimate they send it over and then it has to get approved.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. So they'll send that back a uh uh an approval uh leave an email I always like to give an email because then I send her over the approvals because when they come back like well who approved this months down the road it's like Well this guy here's the email.

Chi Ejimofor
So it you 100% get an email back on every estimate. Yeah. Some that's something is somewhere.

Daniel Vargas
If it's call ins, I have one email me too. super calls my phone like hey I need you this day I'm like okay I need you to email me requesting what you need what day you need it and what time you want it so and then I send that over to Donna
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And what I saw from Dawn, she has like she'll have like PO numbers and kind of weird stuff. Yeah, we get all that. So they tell you, so they like Whether when you're they'll tell you if there's a special PO or something.

Chi Ejimofor
They'll always they'll always tell you that volunteer it. Yeah. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And I always ask it. That's like the first guy. I always make sure that's part of my questioning. It's like okay, you guys got a specific PO you need because they might not care, like the site managers, you know, superintendents.

Daniel Vargas
But the people in their office care. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, so you always so you get the uh and then in that I guess in the uh what you ask in general the information you get from them, you ask you said you the time, uh The time dates uh services needed.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Um location obviously.

Daniel Vargas
And then they're estimated about how long they estimate the job's gonna take us um when it's falling like that. About 85% they'll send me pictures of their streets.

Daniel Vargas
Like, hey, this is what it is. Yeah, thank you.

Chi Ejimofor
So uh what percentage like do you uh do you think you all like do you have to do you always go out and like check or is it like based on pictures you can you can do what you're like 40 percent
Daniel Vargas
time I go out. Okay. But other than that, it's yeah, they send me pictures or we talk about it, or I've already been to the job site for something else and seen it and know the project.

Chi Ejimofor
And is there kind of like an av like just based on like lot size, like you can just okay, just generally is there like a default like you you know, we could just be like, yeah, it's probably gonna take two hours and we're gonna have to or is it like sh Very variable based on like season or like weather, you know, I don't know.

Daniel Vargas
It it all depends on the upkeep on the project throughout when they were building that Right, so it all depends on how clean they kept their projects. That's the only thing that hurts us.

Daniel Vargas
So if they didn't like go through every once a month or something and run a sweeper through, I mean we got I got videos of us pushing piles of dirt, piles of dirt. They left landscaping on there, so we gotta push it through, shovel it off, or push it.

Chi Ejimofor
Wow, so you okay, so you spray it down, but sometimes if the if there's like a physical amount on the site you have to get the shovels and you just toss it off and the little grills to the side So that's a manual, like you don't have we don't have like a we don't have uh that machinery to mess around with it.

Chi Ejimofor
Um do we ever require them to move like big stuff like that?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah yeah, yeah So when I go up to like a Sodella, if you hear Sodella, that's gonna be you'll just imagine a dirty project. Okay. One of the dirtiest ones you've got to do. How do you call that? Sodella, S-O-E-E. L L A.

Chi Ejimofor
Sedella.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
It's a general contractor.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, it's a general general contractor. They do a lot of like apartment buildings or like condos and stuff But those guys will they'll pour their asphalt first and then the whole time while they're building their pads and their landscaping they're just piling it on the asphalt and not take care of it till the end And then we come through and have to powerhouse this whole thing.

Daniel Vargas
Okay. And that that job takes us 13, 14 hours to do. Wow. It all depends on upkeep. That's why I like to get pictures or go out and see see the surface and make sure.

Daniel Vargas
See how bad it really is. Uh okay. But I have like Sedella because leave your ass and I told Sadella, hey, like I can't touch this yet. like get us in skid steer in here with some labors and do this.

Daniel Vargas
I said, well or you can hire us to get it hire us to come. I was like, we can we're more than happy to, you know, rent a skid steer and broom stuff for and then we'll bring our labors out and clean it up.

Daniel Vargas
You can make double the money enough to get all that king.

Chi Ejimofor
And that would be where you would also temp labor that as well, but you rent the truck and have one of your guys do that. Okay. Um how how often, I mean this is a random uh like how often do you show up and it's not, you know, it's you know very different than your that you expected Not too often.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, cool. It's good.

Daniel Vargas
I was running into everything so nothing surprised me no more.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Well not surprising, but yeah, it's like okay. So like based like It's usually the same, but then even like probably ninety nine ninety percent, it's like, oh okay, there's like a little bit more dust or a little less, or we can just move this out of the way, a little pile.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so it's approved. Uh you get you get uh you get the email approval and then you put it on and then Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And then I get with my guys, I got a group chat with all my guys.

Chi Ejimofor
Well for let's for scheduling. Um so that's when you you break out your uh your notes app or what's or or she'll
Daniel Vargas
I will manually go in the email and get the address and stuff to send out to my guys so they have it in text message. I send them the general contractor, the job name.

Daniel Vargas
the address with the site supercontacts name. Okay. And they are every every one of my guys know as soon as you touch foot on a job site, first thing you do is you get
Chi Ejimofor
So you have like a standard text or I mean like a s not standardized. I mean is it is it almost like in a template every time you send it or is it just like Not a template, it can look a slightly different, but it's generally okay, it's more like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
So you said it has the the the general contractor.

Chi Ejimofor
The name of the okay, name of GC.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, and the name of the job site the addresses the address for the job site and then it has the the site contact information on there as well
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So you'll see an approval. Okay, so the and the the approval she'll put it on s this Excel thing.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and then you print that. Is that what I understand? Okay, so after the um
Daniel Vargas
After approval, it uh goes on schedule on Don's uh and these are the contract jobs like that that are we are that's what goes on Don's schedule and these call-ins don't go on the schedule
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, for contract jobs. Okay, so for contract jobs, they go on her sheet.

Daniel Vargas
Like, yeah, if they're going on schedule, they're they're on our schedule because they're getting hit multiple times throughout the week or a couple times throughout the week. If it's just a call in like hey I need you this day to watch this they don't really go they have me I I handle all that through text messages with my guys
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so so there are stuff so dot sheet is like one level but and you'll print that but then there are call-ins and mainly call-ins Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Um that like need it, you know, within a day or you know, the next couple hours Saturday or something.

Chi Ejimofor
And those you'll make sure you'll get you will get an email but and confirmation and everything, but it just doesn't get printed onto a schedule
Daniel Vargas
That's when I take it and I make that template on my text message and send it to the guy that is going to be taken care of.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay
Daniel Vargas
Which all this should be getting a lot better with this new checking set, the busy busy, because I can do all of that off of that app.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. I did see yeah okay so with busy uh with busy busy I saw people can uh people can like obviously check in check out would they be checking it would they be clocking in overall um I saw that that okay I was looking at her uh Ava's thing.

Chi Ejimofor
So they would basically clock in here, uh huh, go to a job site
Daniel Vargas
press like the little switch button like right down the job is that correct way so the way it's gonna be going for us since like we travel all the time is there's gonna be a travel button on there Basically travel time.

Daniel Vargas
They're gonna clock in at the yard and then they'll hit travel time when they leave the yard and then they'll clock into the job site
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And then they'll clock out of that job site and hit travel time back to the yard and then hit clock out. Or if they're going to a different project, look at travel time, clock into that project, clock
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then our job will job sites actu or all the information will that be like in the app per person? So they're just like going down the list. I'm in this one.

Daniel Vargas
Every one of my guys is gonna be able I'll be able to put in your schedule for the whole day that you day previous or the week previous. Okay. Like if they're just an on-site truck driver, I can put it in and I can add it to every one of their days, their eight hour days, and tell them exactly what time they can clock in and what time they need to clock out to Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And it flags me if they do it at different times.

Chi Ejimofor
That's sick. And you have a you have a you said you have a there's a you have a guy, you have one or two guys doing it right now or trialing it? One right now.

Daniel Vargas
His name uh Garrett Rich.

Chi Ejimofor
Garrett Rich.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. He's actually off today and all next week his father just passed away.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah, that's true.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, because he's back in New Mexico right now
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, so so now it's less you now you have like you you have like uh I don't know some sort of Um you'll look at your guys uh schedule yeah, how do you decide Who gets what, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Um you have like s yeah, locations for the my I have my on-site truck drivers and I have my route truck drivers. Right now I got three route truck drivers um that kind of just bounce where I have them go for the day.

Daniel Vargas
I got Mick. Mick takes care of the west side And then Chase kind of handles all the central east valley stuff. And then Travis is the same as well.

Daniel Vargas
We kind of just Fills in on the Travis? Yeah. Change Travis and Mapford and Wi-Fi route drivers.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then the other all the other guys are like on site. Eight hours a day. Yeah. And they're s they go to one basically one could one job all day. Okay. And it's a that job can change, but they are on one job depending on the day.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Every day.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, I'd like to designate a driver for that job site and just keep him there because then he learns that project, he makes good morale with the superintendents and everyone on the job site, and he just stays Some of these projects will last us two years.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And so they'll just be and you'll try to I guess it doesn't matter because they just go there the whole day. So you just you know, you have your guys, okay.

Daniel Vargas
They clock in there, clock out there.

Chi Ejimofor
And they all all those guys they're f They're just have a full schedule right now? Yeah. Okay. Okay. And if if you got a new No So you have a they have a full schedule right now if there's like hey I don't know one of these big guys hey we need a thing.

Daniel Vargas
I'll I'll push them out in a couple days, you know, until I know how we have to be scheduling, figuring it out. What day I have an opening, like hey I really can't you to this day if that works. If you want us still then we'll come on that day. But right now we just ain't got the the manpower to help you guys out.

Chi Ejimofor
So right now we are at capacity for like eight hour, twelve hour, whatever the thing like daily things. And then I mean you we have you as like all right we're gonna get you out there.

Daniel Vargas
Um so which I try to help out some like signed Um me actually doing labor working and helping my guys make money is making our profit on our side look a little bit better, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah, because your salary, I guess? Okay. I was gonna say, you know, they got you. I mean, you know, that's part of the salary gig, you know, you get the butthers we like rain.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. Yeah. June.

Daniel Vargas
Like, okay, I'll see you guys later.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so yeah, right so is it um okay, so you're good right now and and the the floaters can you know they they fill in the gap or the colors and stuff like that.

Daniel Vargas
Especially 'cause it's like a couple of them. Something like right now Mick has some downtime between projects. So when I never I get a call in I know his downtime is between 10 and 1130, right?

Daniel Vargas
That's a little hour and a half I got to be able to use him somewhere. If Colin comes in now.

Chi Ejimofor
Will you like if something came in right now, would you like start to all right Mick Mondays are all now you're at the site on Mondays? Would you so okay, so you so we're not like
Daniel Vargas
We're not cooked if something comes through, but it's like it especially like if something bigger came through I would push some more onto another guy and have this guy cover that shift because he has the leeway, you know the downtime whatever to pick up a couple we might
Chi Ejimofor
work a little longer today but you know everyone's gotta be a team player yeah you know and those and those okay and those guys are generally okay with like kind of overtime during the week but just just not like on the weekends yeah
Daniel Vargas
Okay, that's
Chi Ejimofor
And then, you know, Damn, so they're just like sitting there, they're just all day long kinda like they have a big ass big ass water truck and just spraying dirt. And then they spraying dirt all day. Yeah. They got music or something now?

Chi Ejimofor
Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's say. Yeah. Listen to Joe Rogan or something, man. That's too much.

Daniel Vargas
They all got their podcasts going on on their heads. Okay. I even bought them like four or five radios hanging in them out some guys that little like little bullet speakers were cheaper.

Daniel Vargas
That's
Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah, I think that's okay. So that's so right now it's kind of you know you have uh Okay. Busy busy will you'll have like the schedules. But so you have it I saw your the note what is the notes thing exactly that these is just all my work complete.

Chi Ejimofor
These are the work complete. What's a work um So basically my guys send me
Daniel Vargas
Text me or email me over their timesheets for that day exactly what they did for that day and I go through okay so Mick did WD as straight as springs from 630 was his first hit And then that slash tells you at 2 p.

Daniel Vargas
m. it's 2. 15 to 3 p. m. was his second hit. So he hit that job site twice that day. And then he went on and so forth and did the, you know, the water here. And that was pretty much all he did for that.

Daniel Vargas
Mind you, this is my oldest drive. This dude is 85 years old.

Chi Ejimofor
Jeez.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, so we take it easy on it. Yeah. Right? Yeah. He's been in the company longer than I has. That's wild. And he and he likes, I mean I guess his experience, he just likes being outside and doing all that.

Daniel Vargas
So then then yeah, it just goes on this guy was off, Robert was here, he was at Whitey Turner, City North, Westpac, this guy I always with certified payroll jobs you always put certified payroll so when they're doing payroll they know because on certified payroll That job might be paying our guys more, right?

Daniel Vargas
If they're actually calling for a higher pay on certified payroll, we have to pay our guy what they're calling for. If our guy only makes 24 but they're calling that that that position to make 26, we have to pay our guy.

Daniel Vargas
26. Yeah. But if he makes 24 and they're calling to make 20, we still pay him 24. Okay. But we got to keep track on stuff like that
Chi Ejimofor
And hits is uh and they get they ch you we charge per time the the driver goes out an hour minimum. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah at 25 an hour plus the 10% fuel charge.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay Cool. Okay, so this is like so uh so this is like the end of the day. So when you do you have like your the sk like how do are you just aware?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, how do you know I guess You s yeah, how do you know what drivers are doing what on what day? Like do you just have it in your head in general or or it's is it scheduled somewhere you have like a list of all the guys and you're like this is this or like yeah how you we have a list like I said
Daniel Vargas
for the contract jobs. Now my floaters is kind of up in the air, right? I'm sending them a as we're getting calls, we're sending them and sending them. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
That's it. So for the contract, so in Don's file it does it have any like guys nam or yeah it has guys names guides names or phone numbers all of it okay I need to see okay yeah I I think I saw one of her things but I didn't see the other one okay So it has that has, okay, so all the things that are, okay, yeah, all the contract drivers, it's listed on there, and then all of the floaters, you're just handling that day to day, kind of pushing them out, doing stuff.

Daniel Vargas
It's you you you see how much my phone blows off. Yeah, right. So it's I've gotten a couple calls, but it's literally constant everyday calling Yeah every oh snap you know I need a truck here I need to chuck here and they have your number?

Daniel Vargas
Yes or they have the office's number in which we got this call system if I missed it they'll send me an email and I'll call the customer right back.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um and they well, are they keep do they keep track of of the call system or anybody? Is that are they keeping track of like responses? Do you have to like respond you have to respond to that email and say like I got it or something?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
And if you don't then they'll keep coming back to you like hey was this handled because it didn't take care of.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And so they have they have something that they're looking they have a system somewhere wherever they're at, they're looking at a whole nother office doing it. Yeah. And they have they're they they can probably see Do they send it to you?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so they know they hear a certain thing, they send you it to you, they send it to Jason, they send it to somebody.

Daniel Vargas
Whoever's division is a part of the calls of the case.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and they have some sort of um Have some sort of system where they can see like if you followed up and they don't mark it as followed up or not.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Um, okay. And then, okay, and the say like I mean I guess they're uh this what's the theoretical like the salespeople are they want the salespeople to kind of be getting calls instead or something or like and um I don't I don't know that's that whole situation I understand it yeah I get it um
Daniel Vargas
where the salespeople are like the site project managers at the same time. Yeah. I get it. I guess it takes much stress off of me, right? Like I'm not getting a call from YouTube intended getting bitched at this guy messed up or nothing but at the end of the day I still have to go out there and suit the customer.

Daniel Vargas
So I I would personally prefer that not to go that way. Like if I would prefer to be contacted if my guy are doing something wrong with Ryan. Yeah, yeah, so you're aware of the direct like you do get in contact with me about it, but seems like multiple steps because it's like now they gotta call them and then these guys call me and then I still have to go back and talk to the customer.

Daniel Vargas
You know what I mean? So it's like adding another person just But that's what I was trying to understand.

Chi Ejimofor
I was trying to understand the because I was like, yeah, we have all these when I first came into the company I I didn't even know yeah, I didn't know we had I didn't know that there were sales. And I kinda found out and I was like Wait, what are these guys I mean I I understand new work and stuff and I understand relationship but I was like wait what are these guys doing out there?

Chi Ejimofor
Um so it is like a um So they're they're on site and they this it's it's an extra person that's on site that that that somebody can I guess complain to. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So theoretically uh you have a body that can receive a complaint that may not be addressed the person doesn't want to call or something I guess okay how much I mean You guys these guys have been around, I guess what, I mean the longest was eight months or something, Lacey.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh I mean how many, how much communication how much uh like stuff has come from her or like stuff in general over you know has it ta has it taken a any uh percentage or something like away or is it really just like at the end of the day now you're getting like 5% less, but now you have her kind of uh talking or one of these guys.

Daniel Vargas
No, I my some water trucks out here, we're in Arizona So obviously we stay busy. Yeah. So we stay busy. Um now since they have been on uh I don't know whether it's to do with them or Tim.

Daniel Vargas
I I like to say do them give him better for the doubt, but yeah, like I said, we got more on-site contact jobs
Chi Ejimofor
You have gotten more on-site.

Daniel Vargas
Right. So then that's that's easier for me because like you said, I get I I just manage a guy that goes to one spot every day, you know? So I do like that. Um I I since they've been in
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so they're okay, but and then even with those on-site contract jobs, now those people are still hitting you up though. After like we get the we get the work and they're calling you.

Daniel Vargas
you know, interview my driver and then I you know watch the job site and then and get the whole detail down from my driver and then do a route around the job site and so they know me so now it's like
Chi Ejimofor
Now you're the water truck guy and they're just hitting you up every time. That's cool. Okay. So you're not really you you're not you're not you don't have to you don't you're not talking with sales a bunch or really that at all too much They're just you're just now getting more jobs.

Daniel Vargas
Brandon more than Lacy.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, for sure.

Daniel Vargas
Brandon's definitely gotten more eight hour jobs than Lacy
Chi Ejimofor
When you say he'd gotten like he'll call you and say like hey we have a this I have this.

Daniel Vargas
I just got another job. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah I just got another job for you.

Daniel Vargas
Eight hours a day, one water truck, you know, one driver.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he so there is okay, that and that's so that is one of the sources of like, oh somebody's coming to you with something and then you then go out. Okay. So they the
Daniel Vargas
Brandon's really good at it. He'll just handle it. Like he'll do all the communication with the super, set up the meetings, do all this, and then he'll tell me when the meeting is and then I'll show up to the meeting.

Chi Ejimofor
And he'll be at the meeting as well. He'll be at the meeting.

Daniel Vargas
Okay. Brandon's good show
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he's really okay I'll have to meet after meet that guy. Um Okay, that's sick.

Daniel Vargas
Um yeah, like you said those thousand miscellaneous things that they did
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's the that's the fun. Uh okay. Uh is there any other random okay I think I got most of this. uh intake setup operations.

Chi Ejimofor
Um Mm, how many I guess how many new uh I guess you say you get like yeah how many the the for the floaters and like random stuff I mean We're talking calls and all this stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean your job is like directing all of this, you know, you're the you're the guy, so it's probably hard to estimate. Yeah, I guess If you had to like ballpark, you're not getting any emails, I guess. Oh you are getting some you oh you have them on your phone.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah I guess from each lead source so you have Call-ins, call direct call well, yeah, I guess from each lead source, like direct to you, like somebody calls your phone Um good.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And are you like noting, I mean I guess we're not really taking um Are we taking any sort of uh what's it called? Date? Like if somebody calls your phone versus something in the estimate or any at any point are you like making a note of oh this was a call in or this was a You know, email or something like this.

Daniel Vargas
Not necessarily like that they called me or they emailed me or nothing like that. No.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, that's fine. Okay, so in general, uh yeah, so for yeah from the different sources like let's say and what you prefer calls, email, you don't care, whatever.

Daniel Vargas
I if that's a response I always say Shoot me a text or all. Yeah. Because like I'm in the field, I'm driving newness. I don't get the time to check my email. Don't get a computer to the phone. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you have an email on your phone? Usually you do email. Yeah, you just logged in. Okay, so everything right now is responded to probably theoretically.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, good. Okay, sweet. Um Yeah how many yeah I guess how many well maybe just overall let's say like jobs in a day per day maybe per week yeah in a day I could pick up probably four or five call jobs that called me directly
Daniel Vargas
Every day.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Whether it's like, okay, I need it tomorrow or I need it next week.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And that's calls Um if we include like all the direct contact, like maybe even email, uh text, so it's just four to five in general. Um
Daniel Vargas
In a week, it varies. It all depends on that week. Like whether it's rain week, we it's good, yeah. It we're a little bit down besides track outs obviously when it rains guys start to pull out of jobs and we start mud putting mud down the streets.

Daniel Vargas
We'll get calls from water trucks to come wash that down. Okay. I'd say toll wall in a week. No thing, three. Maybe pick up on the right low sign on that there and one hole on the left side.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's for and then you'll put that on your your drivers and then I guess for contract stuff that's a little bit more less less frequent. Yeah. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah well I uh and like I said I always get that email confirmation and it always gets forward over to Don so she has it in the state or I have it on my email when they try to say well I didn't request this or this that it's usually not we have because the site superintendent will contact me like I got a good report hundreds of superintendents out here from working SWIFT and stuff.

Daniel Vargas
They know me, they watch me build up. So like they'll call me and just tell me to get it done. Okay, all right, or give me your email and I'll get it done, right? It doesn't necessarily mean that the PM won't be paid that much to do that up.

Chi Ejimofor
Do we charge more for like I don't know. Do we charge more for like, I don't know, tomorrow or whatever? Is there any context?

Daniel Vargas
be hiring the prices just to even be working the weekends. Yeah. Just maybe give these guys maybe give these guys a center if you want to work more on the weekends.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so right now it's just a standard pretty much a standard hourly thing for everything. Um 125 an hour for the truck, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
145 an hour for a laborer if you have them.

Chi Ejimofor
And then you're th you're thinking about uh like different prices, contract versus like random versus weekend. Or is that is that the split or is it more like just kind of weekend stuff would be a different price.

Daniel Vargas
No, I did that like you said, this is going to be the support it. Um I'm trying to charge more for like instead of calling like hey you know see how I just I just helped you out. You know we're too four Two to four days out and you know we got to go in the day, you know, emergency job response I think we should be definitely charged a little bit higher by helping people out.

Daniel Vargas
That's what desert services have been known for though.

Chi Ejimofor
That's like Yeah, so you don't want to like yeah, it's it's one of those known for just getting it done for.

Daniel Vargas
Like, hey, they call this where they're they're coming out to get it done for. And that's what we're known for, so it's kind of hard for me to say that we should charge more, but I think it might lose us a little bit more businesses or people that have any.

Chi Ejimofor
And people and people are used to your prices.

Daniel Vargas
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
I guess if they're literally calling you up, then they know how much they're gonna pay. They know they already if they're calling you up, they're like they know how much they're gonna pay. So you wouldn't like, hey, by the way, it's like an extra twenty dollars. Like, what the hell?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah Okay, so that that's the so there's like a idea like corporate like you should get paid more maybe there's an idea especially for weekends but but it's also like you're it's a little something with existing existing customers.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah yeah Especially like, you know, customers have been using this company before I was here, that now I've met and they're like, yeah, we love you guys, been using you since I was your age, you know, then.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay. So yeah, I guess um I think I understand most of this.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, it's complicated. I know there's not a lot of uh yeah, it's yeah it's kind of just Yeah. And like I said, I I'm I'm help I'm trying to get a rap on all this shit.

Daniel Vargas
Like I was just kind of just don't exist anymore. It's I mean it's a work world.

Chi Ejimofor
It's amaz I was like that's what have to I mean I talked to a lot of um when people find out like I do help bus uh you know I used to help with you know rent random businesses and when people find out they're like you know they they'll tell me about their business ideas and all this stuff and I get a lot I hear a lot of stuff But the biggest thing is like one probably 100%.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean really 100% like 99% of people they haven't they want to like they want to automate something that doesn't exist They want to like they give me a process for I'm like bruh like do the j make them make a dollar yeah and then show me what you did and then I can like then I can maybe help you so you guys are like this is like I one hand like before when I was younger I was like oh my god it's too much but now I'm like I mean okay now it's it's honestly it's better because there's something that's happening so I can work with something.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. If there was you know some people coming to me with like You know, I'm like, Okay, I'll help you and then I'm like, Well wait, ooh yeah, I'm like well I'm not building your business my my friend like I I'm not gonna help you.

Chi Ejimofor
You need to figure out what you're doing. So this is it's better, um but then of course you have s you have some things where you know people are used to certain things but But that's for me. I'm like anything that I do I have to make sure like the uh not a five year old can do it, but like somebody who's having a terrible day and who's really annoyed and something that's like Yeah, I d I don't wanna I don't wanna enter some and okay.

Chi Ejimofor
I hate paperwork. I do you know, I've had the my first year of bureaucracy, so I'm like dude Yeah, we're just install we're installing a thing. I'm yeah, my last uh company yeah, Pfizer.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm right all everything for project done, everything. We had six million multi-million dollar machine, everything was good. And I just had an email on the morning of the job from somebody I've never heard of, random executive It's like blowing up, like, you know, what what's going on here?

Chi Ejimofor
I had everything organized, but I was like, man, this is uh You know, it's annoying. But so I get I get it. Um okay and then I guess as far as uh so the close out for you as as far as the job goes is like you send the you send the work completes over to Don.

Daniel Vargas
Angel takes care of the building. And uh And see like right now I'm behind on my working face because I've just been so caught up with stuff, right?

Daniel Vargas
Like yeah. and everything like I gotta get her those work completes. And then when those don't get in, then I got her, I got Kendra and everyone on me like where's your shit?

Chi Ejimofor
Generally like best best the best world is you're sending work completes at the end of every day. Or I mean what's end of every day is like best best world. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Not often, right? So
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah of course. So usually you'd say it's like it there's like a one to two day lag depending on the week.

Daniel Vargas
If not more, so
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, one yeah, let's I mean it could be let's just say I don't know three or five day life.

Daniel Vargas
Let's put it this way. I'm probably work more hours than anyone in this fucking I'm here at four or five in the morning. Earlier most days and don't leave till
Chi Ejimofor
So theoretic I mean I mean how does so busy busy technically if they clock in on the job then it Is there a dashboard for some higher level?

Chi Ejimofor
Like for I guess have you seen it? So you so in the future, I don't know. I you you seen the potential. Is it like Basically that part is gone.

Chi Ejimofor
So you're just sending maybe they can even see it, but they can even log in and see at that point. So it's more of like either just screenshot or like export or or even just like hey it's done or not even it's done they do you is there do you think that I guess I'll I'll talk to them later but
Daniel Vargas
Will they do you think they'll just directly be going in there or do you think you'll still still formatt it up to where it's just well I don't know because like they'll be able to go in there and just get all my drivers Right, but it's just my driver, there's no one else in the company.

Daniel Vargas
And that's basically what I'm doing for them now, just taking my guys' work and putting it in with one sheet of paper. Yeah and it's already in the B right there. So there shouldn't be a reason for them not to be able to go and do it, but I don't want to put more work on other people's.

Chi Ejimofor
That's what I'm saying. It's like, because I remember with executives, you know, I'd make a dashboard, but And I'd always be like, the dashboard's right there. And they're like, send me an email with the dashboard.

Chi Ejimofor
I would they would literally rather have a PD like a picture of the dashboard in the email that they can be like Alright. And then be done rather than get on the computer, log in.

Daniel Vargas
That's kind of what I what I what I'll try to keep this important, just keep like a little easier for me.

Chi Ejimofor
And I yeah, I see and that's and that's the part where it's like You know, you can have some beautiful autumn it's like but at the end it's like it's more what what what works and what works with the people that are that are here It's like if I can disrupt her job as maybe as little as possible with what's comfortable and then the stuff she doesn't like try to mess with.

Chi Ejimofor
Um
Daniel Vargas
Anything. She's my biggest help out here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh okay, typical cycle. Okay. Uh Okay, and okay, what's done work, billing, okay, customer direct okay, you get that.

Chi Ejimofor
You don't have any final I don't know there's no final contact with the customer or anything it's just uh it's done and they the billing hits them up basically. Or yeah you don't yeah Uh uh I kinda I heard that there's like some some issues sometimes I guess.

Chi Ejimofor
Um what I don't even know what that means, but I guess what uh let me see what's what is the question? Yeah, I guess what are the What uh if are there any pain points or bot like are there any issues what am I asking Or what issues come up?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so I I I heard like we have we have people we have I guess you have trucks um uh have issues sometimes.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah breakdown obviously the truck repairs and maintenance This is some of it. A lot of the fleet Lieutenant bought it was old. Yeah. Right? And ran down. So he moved in slowly but surely with his help repairing, making the cost costly repairs on them.

Chi Ejimofor
So and I I think what from what I heard the Porta Johns have like the brand brand new probably and then we have what's the we got a couple new water trucks and then the roll-offs are the second underneath Porta Johns they got like
Daniel Vargas
Looks like it's a most brand new trucks out here.

Chi Ejimofor
So truck repair, maintenance. I mean, how often does a tr like I mean it's kinda uh now maybe it's less, but yeah, like is it like once a week? Is it like once a month? It all depends on the truck, the year of the truck.

Chi Ejimofor
Or just how often do you get do you have an issue with a truck going having an issue So like monthly?

Daniel Vargas
That individual truck or just in general.

Chi Ejimofor
In general. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Straight up. Okay. There's a problem with the truck every day. There's not There's something rattling with you remember we're on job sites, we're on construction sites and with hitting boats and rattling around and you know that so there's a lot that bumps loose and how oft I guess uh the other question, how often is there like a
Chi Ejimofor
you know, pulls a truck out of service uh like that affects you twice a month. Twice a month, okay. One And those guys do those DOT forms daily.

Chi Ejimofor
They're supposed to.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, yeah, no they do. We've been on them. But it's just all drugs out there.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. The truck's maintenance. Um I guess the accidents and stuff is rare. Yeah. Okay. But sometimes it can happen. Yeah, it happened this week over there. And that's we're like once every three months.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean it's it's really random, but like maybe even yearly, like what are we talking?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, like once a year? Yeah, once we barely ever get in a car accident. Okay. Ever Um we see more of that out of like sweepers and roll-up books.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so it's like okay. It's not even once a year, but maybe once a year. Okay, so it's not that's not something to like I don't know, we don't need to okay. Yeah, and you're sitting there spraying, it's a different thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh so truck repairs, maintenance, accidents, uh I guess people being out is I mean unscheduled out like unsed or do most people request out like in advance and you have no issues kind of with with that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So then the the main so truck repairs, maintenance, and then I guess labor. Labor is the biggest thing, uh general labor.

Daniel Vargas
Absolutely my biggest thing. 'Cause I just feel like you know Tim said talked to me about you know the poor one of the quarters where like we were under, you know, from before history and I'm like and I told him too, I'm like, look about how much we've used labor systems compared to before.

Daniel Vargas
So that's where a lot of our profit large and seal is paying into them.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh do you have I guess somebody is, maybe Tim is, but are is there like a I don't know, a per job. Maybe it maybe it's Kendra's well. Is there a per job? Like are are we tracking?

Chi Ejimofor
Are we doing any sort of like Well, I guess it wouldn't I don't know fluctu I don't know how much it would fluctuate but yeah some sort of cost versus expense like thing on jobsheet He hasn't and that's per le co like I don't know what do you per pro what do you call these these things projects what what do you call it I don't know if he does it per project but he does
Daniel Vargas
He has an overall overall for you know how many hours he's paid out to how many hours we build.

Chi Ejimofor
He has it, okay.

Daniel Vargas
And then what and obviously the the cost of in repairs of the bigger repairs are we've made in the water trip side too.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay. So uh so like on a per job thing or per not per j what what would you what do you call each thing? Would you you call it a project, call it a contract, call it a job? Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh So yes, we have contract projects and then you have like one-off projects, so it's this is the it's all projects. So we don't really we don't really um or you don't see you don't have any like thing on you you can't see anything on hey I I had this this guy this truck did this job and we have this is finished yeah we paid out this much we got in this much and then but then maybe okay Something broke down and then now this job's like out of thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, we don't have anything like that. Okay. Um do we track anything with regards to job like do do you keep track of any anything with regards to like job?

Chi Ejimofor
Jobs like I don't know what we would keep track of, but I don't know if performance or complaints or really No, we we always keep um so when when we get complaints
Daniel Vargas
I file it with HR. Oh, sure. So we books are getting right up to some more warning. So all those are documented for sure. Complaints 100%. We're trying to make sure that we're doing the best we can.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so complaints are documented with HR. So in that would do is there like a form or something or is it just like you just you'll just send out an email letting them know this customer called this was the complaint point this is who it was about and um and then you'll have like the project project information do we have project numbers or is it just uh some have numbers but some a lot of them it's more just like whatever the name you just put in a name Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Job name. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, sure. Projects. Yeah. Alright, cool, cool. Would it would um Would that like help you at all in any way, shape, or form to like know to see that like in and out like per job or in some dashboard or something like
Daniel Vargas
Well I think I think it'll help them out eventually for the future too and future-wise estimating, right? Being able to see how much money other is be making on more projects.

Chi Ejimofor
So to be to to be able to yeah, I mean I guess you don't have a computer, but you see them do the estimating, like you could do it. There's no issue there's no reason you can't okay. But yeah, being able to estimate your own jobs and then seeing the estimate and then this this was actually the final.

Chi Ejimofor
uh uh cost yeah because that would yeah probably affect that would affect obviously your behavior like if you're like oh shoot we're Yeah. Like losing money on like a lot of these things, it's like, well no, we have to charge like you have to charge more.

Chi Ejimofor
It's a company, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Or figure out a way to do it a little bit less possible.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Have we raised prices like historic like just over time? Just overall, um just as of with economy or whatever. Just as a yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And you communicate uh how do you is that communicated I mean I guess you just yeah how is that communicated out?

Daniel Vargas
You're talking about raising costs?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah, like yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, Tim sent sent us out a whole thing of, you know, this is what I want to charge for these. Um divisions now from now on and what in our division what we wanted to raise like our on-site jobs you know well eight hours a day and stuff we were charging at like 95 and now we're up to 110 an hour And then what we're raising a little at a time.

Daniel Vargas
It's like one thing at a time.

Chi Ejimofor
And whenever you get that, you know the next day you start getting calls like that's what I So you're like, hey, yes, by the way, we had a new thing. Yeah. And okay.

Daniel Vargas
This is our new cost, you know, obviously with life, everything's going up.

Chi Ejimofor
And do you ever have to like do any like kind of salesiness or they just usually accept it? Have you ever like uh they're like alright I mean I guess it probably yes but you like say it's a yeah it's 110 now and they're like all right well I'll call you later or something or usually they just accept it.

Chi Ejimofor
90%. Okay. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. And if they if they need it, usually if their their question is it's they want an estimate sent out to 'em, they'll call us and they'll do the estimate and all that. Well but most of the time they they go with us because we're pretty much cheaper than anyone else out there.

Chi Ejimofor
What is uh and what you said it's like 125, what's 110 for water trucks plus eight hours a day. For eight hours. For eight hours it's wait, is it different for you said eight hours a day is 110 per hour?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Eight hours a day Monday through Friday is uh 110 an hour
Chi Ejimofor
Uh he said there's a gas thing? And okay, so you have a diff you have one twenty and you do have a different price for callings?

Chi Ejimofor
Is that I think you said one twenty five or something for that?

Daniel Vargas
So um on the water on the the site cleanups and stuff are charging $125.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, so maybe I start to okay. So people aren't getting dust or water trucks usually on the weekends or never So it's not even so the eight hour the $110 pri price is like yeah everybody only schedules on the week
Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Usually for the full day.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, so we do have a project like Lake and QTS, they work on Saturdays. hours a day.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, but it's the same same price.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Uh and then site cleanups are 125 plus the same same 10% fuel charge.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. And then $45 per labeling.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh, okay. And you'll you charge that on top?

Daniel Vargas
On top.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that's three guys usually?

Daniel Vargas
Or they No um so you get the 125 an hour is the truck and the operator. Yeah, and then you get two laborers which is $45 an hour so three guys two labor.

Daniel Vargas
Yep. And we usually run on each project probably about two to three trucks. So we're trying to buy like six labors at a time with three operators.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's two uh two laborers per truck. Do they choose that or do you you you basically s you you're like hey this is gonna this is This is what you should do.

Daniel Vargas
This is what I tell I tell them, hey, this is what you really need because it's gonna get the cleanest product that you want. So I always sell the hose guys Unless it's like a neighborhood like the residential builds and stuff and it's just a street going down there and they're like hey we just need the you know street cleaned up and blown off to the gun.

Daniel Vargas
I'll just send a truck out there the front sprayers and the side sprayers.

Chi Ejimofor
When you're determining or telling them how many trucks or how many trucks uh this is before after I've seen pictures or walk the dump. And it's basically and you're are you aiming for them to get done in a certain amount of time?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
What's that?

Daniel Vargas
Well generally well it it all depends on what I think you can get done on that. So um Saturdays I tell my guys too and if I plan a job for a Saturday expect a 10 hour day.

Daniel Vargas
It's not a life office. not a light job, you know. Um now that does happen. We do get smaller jobs like gas stations or something that want clean that's only going to take us for you know hours or so.

Chi Ejimofor
Because that's like because obviously I mean if they're like oh I'm I don't know if they're cheap. I only want one truck, but like one truck on a on a 10-hour day job is like I mean it's gonna be probably longer, right?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah. And then and then those guys just are getting a well what do you tell the I guess My guys? Or what do you for They're like we want to be cheap.

Daniel Vargas
Well I tell them well I'll work to your guys is I'll I'll keep one guy if that's what you guys want.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah so you'll tell them basically like but the l you have a mental limit like probably ten hours and you're like it's just not gonna get done in ten hours so we're gonna have to do two days if you want to do it like that. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And I told him I said or it's you know I'll tell you guys you guys are kind of underestimating what what can be done on this job side done to me it's no offense to you guys or anything but here's my opinion is um you guys are telling me you guys got a total number So I'll work to that total number, but once they get to that number that you guys want us to work up to, we're not gonna work anymore.

Daniel Vargas
Yep. for you guys. Yep. So if this is the amount amount of money you want to spend, this is that's the amount of time I'm gonna allow my guys to stay here and get the job done. But whatever's left after that is not on
Chi Ejimofor
They just hired a guy to be uh like a floater something, Glenn. If you heard about this Uh because there's a they they hire like they have assistant directors or something like this.

Chi Ejimofor
They have a have you I mean the other people there's like at least one assistant. Is it what it's called? Assistant director? Have you ever heard of this Okay. Have they ever had a like an assistant director or something like that for anybody?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. The next guy, you're uh so you're director. Do you have you and you the next under you is like a lead foreman? Yeah, foreman lead. How many of those you just have one?

Chi Ejimofor
So that's one and then everybody else is just yeah. And okay and then you're say your formula is like twenty six dollars an hour, he's been there forever, he's he's good.

Daniel Vargas
Oh my god.

Chi Ejimofor
So they hired him directly as that? No colleague? Okay. No, I moved him up. Okay. And he's been for you, so you he's like he just is so great you're like, oh yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna have cut that issues recently.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's good Uh okay. Yeah, y y uh you're you work uh yeah sounds like you you have um You you work how many hours ish a week?

Chi Ejimofor
Depending on 60 something 60 to 60 plus.

Daniel Vargas
Well then that's 30 week one tell 45.

Chi Ejimofor
It's just if I did that over.

Daniel Vargas
Mentally I I didn't issue.

Chi Ejimofor
Well yeah, because you your job I mean you'd probably then be getting calls like out the wazoo and people would get complaints and it would just Your life would be shittier even though you're working less like it would actually get uh objectively worse.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. And you'd look bad and it's like pride in your work as well.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, they haven't sent the NOI yet to break calls and you've been asking a lot of my colleagues will come at like one or two o'clock in the So it's like okay now I'm moving all the way out to the website where you need to go fix that because I do all the backflow book notes for the high-box and stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
That's what yeah people they said Yeah, that was like one of the some of the miscellaneous they were uh they were saying wait I have a maybe I have a list somewhere.

Daniel Vargas
The only thing I can't do in the company is run a fucking portage on so and that's our sweet part
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you you personally also fill in for whatever they need to have jobs. They have jobs. And you work jobs. I hope yeah. I mean I hope uh I assume they're paying you a salary uh that that makes it Uh that makes sense, but that's a lot.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. Um fills in. Uh so you uh yeah, they said you fill in SWIP, but then you you fill in anything
Daniel Vargas
Yeah, it's street sweeping because the track out. I'm the only other one class A C BL that can tow that tractor around and operate. I'm the only other one that can operate that tractor.

Daniel Vargas
No one else knows how.

Chi Ejimofor
So you're the so if there is track out whatever you have to do that.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, that's that's what Jason was talking about. No, I don't have to. They have an operator and driver for it, but if those guys can't are sick or calling out, I have to go fill in. Which happens more often than I'd like.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so they have uh SWIP has one guide that's certified or whatever to do it Uh how much oof um yeah I mean I guess how much of your time do Do you think you spend like actually doing manu doing like the the the job of guys, yeah, of like labor, you know I mean per week?

Chi Ejimofor
I mean yeah, are you are you out regularly doing work? So you're okay. Okay, well that's interesting. Like what percentage of your time are you like doing uh what we call what I would call a a director, you know, Jason's sitting at the computer doing director stuff all day.

Chi Ejimofor
What percentage of your time are you sitting there doing director stuff? Like uh you know, calls or
Daniel Vargas
Probably like well calls this all day. Okay, just fielding calls. Yeah, I'm getting calls all day and managing my guys all day, you know. So that director spot never really stops. But I it's just some full points where I get so caught up on doing this job I'll miss a call so then I have to come back to this call and get this and you know.

Daniel Vargas
So it's like I don't think my director spot really stops with the actual full director side of just being able to sit down and manage the
Chi Ejimofor
You could you I mean you could be at a desk here just sitting there and yeah if there was yeah they they'd have to have more guys but like or hire someone in my position and just run
Daniel Vargas
We run wild.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. What do you like? What do you uh you like both, I guess. You like you like getting busy, you like whatever. I'm not worried about it though. So you're you're just filling in all Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's just and that's just the thing where like each team could get a couple more guys and then you would be I needers though, so that like yeah, like so if each team like picked up an extra So you're out doing lot washes?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, so you are doing some of the So we get one guy, maybe you just you'll do the other the out there. Damn.

Daniel Vargas
Sunday I work 14 hours by myself on a lot wash. Running a truck and jumping out grabbing a hose and washing the whole apartment complex Because my guys didn't finish it on Saturday.

Daniel Vargas
They weren't able to finish it, but it had to be done by Monday and the GM called me. It was like like, hey, I need this done before Monday. Yep. Alright, I got you. Called all my guys. All my guys are like, it's Sunday, see ya.

Daniel Vargas
And like, alright.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, do it. That's that's wild, okay. Yeah, it's and so that's just yeah, I d those and those are like in those those are difficult things because it's like some that sometimes I know there's like a Something there's sometimes where you don't have the capacity necessarily for like oh and just hire a full-time guy but then stuff comes up and you're like Oh fuck, yeah, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
So Mary's a lot of things.

Chi Ejimofor
So you need like you need to almost need like a five or ten guys that are cross-trained that can move around as needed with backfill or something like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Are all are all the guys out there I mean not all but like how many are across okay. That's an issue that's an interesting would you s would you say that's a kind of So you mainly so you mainly let's say you so you mainly if you uh pull or whatever like the If you're pull, yeah, you would we wouldn't be talking about ported like all those guys are driving by them so it's like irrelevant completely irrelevant.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's like SWIP or your guys, these are what we're talking about only. Yeah. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
So I guess yeah, what level of Because they the the slip can't can drive a water truck.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Are you talking about like the general labor guys that can't? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So craw as far as I guess cross-training is simple, it's just like I mean you can wash or you can I don't know dig up do whatever they're doing in the in the in the pits there So it is really more of like uh so it's not really a cross-training thing.

Chi Ejimofor
It's this job is simple. It's more of just having labor that um willing to work that's willing to work and then okay and then you have to have enough uh yeah and drive yeah How many more I mean how many more guys do you think just I mean we're in like magical world whatever you get like a whatever amount of money you're like and you find guys how many guys uh do you think you could You're like and you understanding but they have in general, you're like we could bring on ten more guys and be have them working or is it like
Daniel Vargas
Okay. All right. A whole nother crew they could pull on SWIFT is what I'm saying. Pull on a whole nother crew and stay busy. And then that would cut down their time. Basically it would be cutting that group could take on more jobs throughout the week, cutting back their hours on Saturday and allowing more guys to be able to help me out on Saturday.

Chi Ejimofor
I see, I see. Okay, so you would basically decrease the load overall throughout the week and then it would then those guys who normally Would help you out on Saturday would be willing, but you gotta like lower the whole thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that's like a small that is a uh so one kind of opportunity is, you know, having more general labor guys slash even a C D you know, I don't know, a couple more drivers that can work so that you you know So that you're not, I don't know, doing as much random stuff throughout the throughout the thing.

Chi Ejimofor
That's fun.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, there's a there's a couple things, yeah
Chi Ejimofor
Uh higher cruise for I was gonna say is it ha I mean that's probably that's HR that's like Tim or something. I mean uh like how do you request like hey we need more guys like how do you request or just tell Tony
Daniel Vargas
But right now it's just we had a meeting about this when so we had like I told you before we had a pressure washing side. Yeah, there was a whole separate division. Yeah. So when Tim did away with that, we actually had a meeting.

Daniel Vargas
with Jason and the Swift Crew letting them know that I was taking over that division as well as water trucks. And then during that meeting we had made You know, I feel like a through decision, which Don was in there too, that SWIP would be helping me out on all these jobs.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Daniel Vargas
They had Not once.

Chi Ejimofor
Since since that happened. Yeah. Since that's a couple. So they've just been and that's because they're so busy. It's just whatever.

Daniel Vargas
These tank labors are killing me. Not only that, so I have to keep they they they'll send new guys every and every time.

Chi Ejimofor
And then and then there's also so and then You said the quality of ranges, so then you can maybe get compliance or issues because the quality ranges. And the main the thing would be okay, okay
Daniel Vargas
If we just picked up a whole nother street sweeping and like designated them to to do both, yeah. It's like hey you guys are almost floaters. So that'd be like the smartest way I think to go about it.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Okay, you guys you know when you guys are called upon for water truck services this is your guys' priority, but when you're not you guys are going and doing switch.

Chi Ejimofor
So yeah. Okay, nice. Um uh maybe I only have like a couple more. Yeah, probably. Uh They generally people contact you if they need something.

Chi Ejimofor
You said, yeah. And you prefer and you said you prefer that, yeah. Okay. Uh and you see the uh those guys over there in the in uh what's it called?

Chi Ejimofor
Ugh, the maintenance. Those guys are pretty good. Yeah. Those guys are really know what they're doing and they and they get stuff done. Uh do they have an do they um If you have a tr if you have a truck go well that's yeah I guess if you have a how often do you get a truck that goes out of service?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah
Daniel Vargas
Like I said, it could happen to me a couple times a week where like you know batteries die or okay some simple fixes but it does happen where I have to call the mechanic. I call Noah because he's like like I said the on the over the road service mechanic.

Daniel Vargas
And me and him got really really cool to call it just called him to say hey brother this is it this is the job site they're at address this is what's going on
Chi Ejimofor
So it's usually a small little thing? Yeah, and if it's big we just tow the truck back and that's not usually you said it's not usually big, it's like rare. Maybe
Daniel Vargas
Once a month or something. Yeah. Yeah. And now it's it should be getting less because we've been putting a lot of money in these and trucks getting picked up. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh for the little thing do you know I mean does he tell you I guess you yeah you hear uh the guys will call you and be like there's something wrong Do you um all the little fixes do you think that if there was like do could they be caught if I don't know if we had some some people working overnight like doing as just I'm just making stuff up but like Preventative maintenance overnight.

Chi Ejimofor
Would would most of those small things get caught all you know?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, usually most of the time. But I like I said too, it's on my drivers for doing their free trips. Like if you should have caught that for doing Okay, so would post trip. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Would most of these so are those the things that I mean some stuff can just happen, right?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, that's okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Um unplanned, but Would okay so in the situ some situations you would be like technically if you would have been like in a robot and done the the pre-trip perfect you would have caught that he would have caught that or most of the time or most of the time okay But this is like I think the correct I don't know this the pre-trip.

Chi Ejimofor
It's you know they just want to get out there and start working. I guess the sooner they get done, the sooner they get off.

Daniel Vargas
running little links to get the job sites at all.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. You know. And it's like a paper thing and it's and it is they can't you can just like obviously you can just boom boom boom. If you want to. Yeah, yeah. And we don't uh as far I talked to Noah, he was like he said like 75% of people kind of uh he said 75% of people do it Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh I don't know what he meant by that. I guess did he mean like probably some everybody does does everybody do it but they may not like actually physically do it or they may not actually do it.

Daniel Vargas
Maybe.

Chi Ejimofor
So people some people maybe not, they don't maybe they don't even do it.

Daniel Vargas
Some people I my guys, I make sure my guys send me pictures of theirs at the end of the day so I know that they do it.

Chi Ejimofor
So they'll send you they'll basically send you two pictures.

Daniel Vargas
The D V R slips and their touching.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And you just boom boom boom. And then that's on them if they like it's on them whether they're like going outside, like you know, checking the light bulbs or whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
Like But they will send they are actually physically filling them out 100% and sending it whether they're like going or walking around the truck, that's on them. Okay. And some of the things you said most of the things that or like randomly go wrong would theoretically be caught by that checklist.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, um No there's do you think if it was I guess there's and there's no way to I wouldn't even really enforce I mean that's at the end of the day it is what it is.

Chi Ejimofor
But if it was a digital thing you think that it would be easier for I mean I do you do your guys have oh they don't have um any any anything right now. Yeah. But they'll in the future they'll have their at least the they'll have the Busy B app yeah in the future but that's where it's gonna be and they'll be able to take pictures on in there and put their DV offs on the Okay, so they'll Okay, so that'll be like Okay, it is what it is, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I was looking at the I was looking at the maintenance stuff just like casually, seeing what what they could you know, what could be done, you know, just to like 'cause I know that you guys are investing a lot in it.

Chi Ejimofor
But then moving in from like just you know responding to like you know hey we're just pulling I don't know I don't know how they do it but like not pulling but I don't know how I don't know how they would do it but we're just I don't know maybe we have like a crew that's like A little bit later that is just like hitting which that's how it is now.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, so they act technically the second ship doesn't leave the yard until
Chi Ejimofor
I remember the guy he's at 8 o'clock, yeah. I met oh I I don't remember guys' names. He had a little blonde hair I think. Oh blonde hair um Ryland. Yeah Ryland yeah yeah yeah Yeah he came he came.

Chi Ejimofor
I was here late last night for Jim knocked on the clock. So it's uh and the second shift, is it like it's sh I think there's like and there's like two guys kinda per on at a time.

Chi Ejimofor
Are you guys done by then?

Daniel Vargas
Or like yeah, what time are you guys all are you guys are done by latest guys works out to see
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And that's on an on-site job though, you know, out west. So he just leaves home from that project and he goes right down the road. Yeah. So he just goes there and gets in the truck. Yeah. Oh so he doesn't okay, so he just doesn't come back.

Chi Ejimofor
But everybody else comes back to the art. Uh um okay, so he he's done a six for the other guys when when do they I mean it's ranges probably. The floaters I guess it also ranges because uh for him.

Daniel Vargas
Ranges for so most of them I'd say offer like before. Yeah. Yeah. But now if we get like a call in, hey I need a lot wash but we can't start until two or three o'clock, then our guys stay out a little later that time.

Chi Ejimofor
So technically uh best like best case some time some days the um you guys have nine how many trucks do you have to your to par like is it nine trucks?

Daniel Vargas
No no Four thirteen or fourteen?

Chi Ejimofor
Oh okay, so you have a little bit extra coverage. Yeah, so you have coverage here. You have 13 or you know how many? I guess Dutching offer is fine, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
Thirteen. Okay, thirteen.

Chi Ejimofor
You have 13 water trucks and then you have like that little pressure washer thing.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, the pressure washing truck and the pressure wash two pressure washing trailers
Chi Ejimofor
Oh trailers and those get dragged behind the pickup trucker or truck or okay. You need a separate truck to to drag it. Okay Okay, so you have a little bit of uh so if something goes down, it's all good.

Daniel Vargas
You just uh go grab another one real quick, take that to mechanic shop, make sure they're aware of how you're in, because it takes up and Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you have any like I mean I guess historically is there any like You want to have like two more trucks than people, is there anything like that or just like general is it like a vibe? Or I mean you just have more trucks than people is is the general principle.

Chi Ejimofor
There's no exact number or something.

Daniel Vargas
No, I just have more trucks than people people um just because like I said it it would help me too the trucks we have in our yard as of right now are what we consider on-site trucks because they're not CDL roadway Oh really?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, so there's like four of them right here in the yard that we can't even put on the road. So say one of my over the road drivers goes down. I don't have another truck technically to go grab maybe he can safely be on the roads with.

Chi Ejimofor
Wait, so what is that? Okay, so these trucks aren't what does that what does that mean CDO? Like they have they need to be searched?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah they have to be meet all the DOT regulations.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
And if they don't meet up to their regulations or their standards, they Yeah. So what do you do with them?

Chi Ejimofor
You have to drive back roads?

Daniel Vargas
hours a day uses it.

Chi Ejimofor
Wow. Okay, so you literally you drive the uh well I haven't been back there.

Daniel Vargas
Well I have been back there but you have a big old long trade with a five bed truck loaded up on that delivered to the job site
Chi Ejimofor
How many of tr th okay, so four so you have to do this for at least I mean I can I am I dumb
Daniel Vargas
I do it when the project starts, like we'll only do it like if it's a longer project, right?

Chi Ejimofor
And will you leave the truck over there?

Daniel Vargas
I'll leave it on the driver.

Chi Ejimofor
Are all the trucks left somewhere right now or are they back here?

Daniel Vargas
No, uh I got two, three of them left somewhere else and the other one's coming. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Alright, so that and that that's fine. Is that uh I guess it costs money or something to get them CDL.

Chi Ejimofor
What's what what else needs to be done for them to be CDL?

Daniel Vargas
It's just they're so old that they don't have parts like like some speedometers on them Don't worry.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so they like yeah. So they work, they and a car, I mean I'm what's the I mean buying a new truck, I mean what did what's a new truck go for? Or what's it seventy thousand yeah and you would all the if you get a truck you would buy it new probably now.

Chi Ejimofor
No, okay.

Daniel Vargas
No, we buy them new ten three bottles three.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's okay. And what's the range on on the highest pay
Daniel Vargas
You wanted to pay like 60 or 70,000 with a 4K?

Chi Ejimofor
Damn.

Daniel Vargas
So even two 4Ks and then we bought um a 2K Smaller truck too that was like 50.

Chi Ejimofor
When you say 2K, is that that's the 20,000 gallon the smaller trucks, yeah. Okay That's nice.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, nice, nice, nice. Nice, nice, nice. Uh, okay. Nice, nice, nice. Okay Uh okay, so for you said for okay.

Chi Ejimofor
You d you had you did okay, so and you said for hiring you you did you guys did have a meeting, you guys agreed to something technically, but that hasn't really there's been a So if you if you uh and the moment was this uh this was how long I guess when you bought the so you had this meeting like a year ago or something.

Chi Ejimofor
This like Yeah the the yeah the meeting between um Say and me and crew that was like a year ago or even more recently? Even more recently. Okay. Yeah a couple months ago.

Chi Ejimofor
A couple months ago, okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah Um yeah, that was yeah, a lot more recently
Chi Ejimofor
Uh and does Tim and Tanya are they like aware of like the the the uh labor kind of
Daniel Vargas
shortage issue or like are they aware of the dynamic or yeah just to to an extent yeah no Tim knows you know um but he just understands too that switch is loaded the jobs you know
Chi Ejimofor
Uh is there like a downtime in the year where like people aren't doing as much and you have people sitting around.

Daniel Vargas
can come up coming up coming up here soon. Yep. Around that winter time, January, February, February it'll start to kick back up, February, March. I would say because it's been the windier seasons.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. So we we'll start but yeah, here coming up we're gonna go pretty freaking slow.

Chi Ejimofor
So December, January. Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. So you so sometimes we have I mean we have guys standing and I don't know you have to send them home.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
don't come in. Like I started no hours thing, I'll just start rotating guys. That's when we tend to lose people.

Chi Ejimofor
And you've been here for a while. Uh you have how many you say you have nine guys. Uh I mean and SWIP has how many they have a 13?

Chi Ejimofor
14? Yeah. Um yeah, and that in that thing, yeah, you I mean you lose like two, three guys every winter or something or it's no way to like guess, but it's just random. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
And have we like I said, this last winter was probably one of our best. We stayed stay pretty good here. So it all depends. Yeah. Well I try to, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
And I guess with the sales guys and stuff, maybe stuff will be better.

Daniel Vargas
But I uh Like once my hours go slow, that's one of my sales guy goes in the boat. Then I'm out there on job sites selling washings and stuff.

Daniel Vargas
You know.

Chi Ejimofor
What's okay. So and y I guess you know all these guys or you know a bun well, yeah, what does that look like? Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
So you Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So theoretically, I mean there could be a I don't know, you could like I mean you could have a guy that you kinda train or something that you could have your personal sale like your own personal guy that's just going around essentially.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
I what I do is I work with the inspectors because they do the final inspection. right that's telling me when a guy's on his final and if I could go with them like hey what finals have he done this month or whatever and they tell me I'll take that list and I'll go to stop at these job sites and talk to these guys like hey you know we'll come in here make it look real nice for you we we offer pressure washing lot wash cleaning sweepers whatever you need we'll help you guys out
Chi Ejimofor
Follow up after final inspections. And that's something that you'll do uh only when you when you have uh when you have the time you'll follow up on like one
Daniel Vargas
My guys don't have hours or something that's time, I need to be able to do that to make sure, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so a little bit of my Little little uh well I guess we you know and you like uh sounds like you have some rapport with Brandon or something, but one of those guys could be could be like, you know, have uh I don't know, they could be communicating with inspections and just like Following up on all those they could be.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
And which like that what I I know now too, like I'll get with Brandon and Lacey, like if my guys start too low on hours and just let them know like hey, you know, I've got guys about hours. if you can try to look for these jobs throughout the week or something.

Daniel Vargas
Help us out. And they will.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And that's not is it we when you say s um how much of I guess you we're we're selling something that they will they probably need so it's not So much like you're not there's no sales in this you're just like sales you just pull up and you're like, Hey by the way, I heard you you know you guys finished this.

Daniel Vargas
Do you guys need do you guys need somebody to you know and the super's like, Well you're here right now, let's just get it done, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, just put it on schedule.

Daniel Vargas
I planned on doing it anyway. So Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And you and you know usually these oh we have we're already working with them because we have the inspection so it's like they already know us.

Daniel Vargas
So it's like oh by the way and we and before they did their final inspections we were probably on their with switch, fence, portage on, something, track outset. Or I did their backflow hookup and stuff.

Daniel Vargas
And so they know it's someone.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's just like getting that final little uh extra What a thousand bucks ish. It's like a probably the quotes is usually a grand a job ish or no.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean it depends.

Daniel Vargas
For the cleaning?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
That's how much we charge them
Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah, like just in j like overall, yeah. What does it end up well you said no, you said uh a hundred and twenty-five per hour, eight hours, and then they also you have the forty-five per hour for two people. So that's a hundred dollars per hour, so that's like two
Daniel Vargas
hours a day if not more or two days.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, so it ends up I don't want to do math, okay. I want to do math right now. But it ends up being like a couple, yeah. A couple grand ish.

Daniel Vargas
I've done lot washes that we've made charged them fifteen thousand dollars for.

Chi Ejimofor
Really? Just because of the amount of time and all the stuff.

Daniel Vargas
We do those a lot too, a lot of the new uh stores, parking lots and stuff when they're opening and stuff. We do a lot of that.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay. Like does he have like I don't know when as far as like uh does he measure something with regards to you as like is he you know, he's he'll you know, w we need to be making more money.

Chi Ejimofor
Is there anything that he's like tracking with regards to overall? He's made that's the main thing he's tracking with regards to you is like he'll s profit margins overall.

Daniel Vargas
So it's like, okay, you know, like he said, like he said, we paid out this much to our employees, but we, you know, we billed out this much and got this much back. He goes through all that with me and things like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then yeah, data, like pure, I guess data wise, it's like uh But Kendra has probably like who's like I guess Kendra would have like if I asked her like hey give me uh give me September like job like sh Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Kendra would be the person who would have like full can they would have like the full list of jobs, money and people and everything for the entire month. She was like the not C well because you had the N owner, but she was the C did she have a title?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, owner. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
She was basically the owner.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah So the owner was yeah. Did he uh worked?

Daniel Vargas
Was he in Yeah, where he was an office person. Yeah. Okay. So he was in here doing stuff, but he was here in and out, but he ran another um remodeling like home business and Morris Godsdale, high-end houses and it was like always focused on that.

Daniel Vargas

Chi Ejimofor
So Kendra was his like, yeah, hey I'm needed I'm gonna have my passive income over like yeah.

Daniel Vargas

Daniel Vargas
Nothing bad to say.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I mean it's focus you you have to focus if you're you know multiple things you're working on. It is I met those guys.

Daniel Vargas
I mean even yeah, it's like you're you're working on a hundred things yourself, so it's like if somebody See and I think that's what's like do it though is because like I did that for Mike too and he just looked out for him he really did so
Chi Ejimofor
Sweet. So Kendra Kendra and Don have like all the data, all the um and maybe more Kendra than Don, but I'm sure Don does have it And so she's the one that um puts it together for Tim and has something for him to look at for money and all that stuff.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, oh that's Dawn. That does all that, like actual bump. I think he does all the D O N, yeah. DLN. I think he's the one who kind of puts that all together. I'm not too sure.

Daniel Vargas
But for as far as like look at what the money for jobs and stuff like that yeah don't this don't in camera okay that's like I mean that's
Chi Ejimofor
That is fire. Uh yeah. Yes or I guess um and you see you have stuff that I don't know you have issues that come up throughout the day just I don't know Yeah, I guess you you are the it sounds like you are the g I mean I don't she was saying yeah yeah you're saying like uh filling swimming pools and random stuff like you know you know you're the guy who'll schedule it or they need me to go walk job sites because
Daniel Vargas
God knows what. Who knows? They just want it braided down by the tractor because of bushes or whatever you name it. Don't go up there with
Chi Ejimofor
So they'll they kinda people will just ask us to help with stuff.

Daniel Vargas
That's the best simplest way you can put it, but
Chi Ejimofor
So they'll just get comfortable and just be like, hey, uh randomly, yeah, yeah.

Daniel Vargas
You guys got labors and stuff, you guys want to do this? Alright, well what's good, what you need done? Go over there, walk it, see if we can do it Yeah done.

Daniel Vargas
The cover of Jason's house. And you've seen Jason's schedule.

Chi Ejimofor

Daniel Vargas
I see what jobs I need to do for him on there. And he'll let me know and then I just base it off of that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh yeah, okay. You say you get in at like five. If I'm in I mean if I'm in by tomorrow can I ride along? Yeah. And I you I would just need like uh I would just need steel steel toe boots.

Chi Ejimofor
And I have the in the vest that they gave is all good. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And the glas they have glasses and all that stuff in the back. If I'm in, I mean if you see me then I'm going. But if you don't see me, don't wait, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's all dependent on waking up on time and doing all that stuff. So that's safe.

Daniel Vargas
You ever want to just come out and check out a lot wash, you know, for a little bit on a Saturday or something we do.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, just like I mean putting uh yeah, putting like I hear with random things and I'm like I still don't, you know, like I still don't know all the stuff, so it's good.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh yeah, I'll put that five so five o'clock tomorrow. And you you would you would be like out back or somewhere standing?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Daniel Vargas
So I was sitting there smoking a cigarette. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh I get maybe I'll get to meet uh Herbie in the morning because he's he said he's in it pretty early as well.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah he was here that was the old dude that was. Oh yeah that walked by. Okay. I saw him for two seconds. He's the one I to this day respect all he trained me. He's the one who built me in this company. I started working underneath him as well.

Chi Ejimofor
And he's a oh okay so he's one of the also the not office guy because he's in the streets. Yeah he's out he's an inspector.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. And then Logan He's been here a very long time. Yeah, he's also way up to right. Yeah, that's interesting to see that like that's how it worked back then is like you know you started from the bottom and you just proved yourself an old owner and you just talk to him like I said he was a nice very nice guy.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, you know, just let them know what you know and how you can take care of things and oh yeah, here's your shot.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. You think that uh a lot of the You think that a lot of the guys down there if they had like opportunity to do more stuff, do you like how many guys do you think would be interested in like a lot of stuff?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. It's like, hey man, by the way, like if you want to take good training like and do something like you could be an inspector and you know do something yeah. So decent like hundred a hundred percent uh basically.

Chi Ejimofor
Most people I mean I guess more money is more money, so everybody's like Yeah. More money is more money. Because I guess this they're kind of stuck at like between twenty to twenty-six kind of if and there's no like kind of
Daniel Vargas
That's just the water jugs. Like I I don't know what cap they're putting on every division. 2830 or whatever.

Daniel Vargas
So we're all working on that too, trying to figure that out. Is it kind of like that question a lot? Yeah. Of course. And I was like, what
Chi Ejimofor
At this time I I'm trying to figure it out. Are they doing like I don't know they have the ninety days?

Daniel Vargas
But they're working on it, they're gonna do it every quarter. Uh like a like a 25%, 25 cents or whatever the thing is. And they just go up. Yeah, that's what they're doing. They're working on it, on the idea of it. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's just based probably based on you know you're showing up to work on time, no no like complaints. No complaints, no, you know Do you get c I mean do we get complaints often semi?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
It depends. It um I get more complaints on water truck drivers at times and Sometimes I got taken with a grain of salt from the superintendents because like sometimes the super's just having a pissed off day and choosing one person on the job site because he's seen him at that second.

Daniel Vargas
So I gotta take a lot of that into consideration. But I do have talks with my guys like, hey. This is what you need to fix is super quality.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's like, would you say, I mean, how many complaints ish a week? No, no. Or just not even that. Okay. A month?

Daniel Vargas
Yeah. Maybe like one. And that's not yeah, okay, so it's And that's and what is the what do they complain about? too wet or they're not getting it wet enough.

Daniel Vargas
You know what I mean? So it's like too wet dust. And why why isn't he getting that dust spot down there? Just little simple stuff like that. uh now I've had had complaints of guys spraying other people on the case.

Daniel Vargas
On purpose or on accident just like okay water's water's going to be. And then they didn't notice the guy right there and sprayed up and stuff. Damn near ended up in fist fights. Yeah, uh ego ego stuff.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, I see.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. But general it's it's so it's it's like little so is you m okay, so these are just like the general uh things. Nothing
Daniel Vargas
Nine most of the time it's not anything it's like hey just I don't know just you have to say that hey just watch it like less water next time or just less water more water you know I mean or don't be sitting still like sometimes I'll get calls of hey I'm I'm watching your guys He's just sitting still in the truck.

Daniel Vargas
And that's where I'm like, okay, hit falling. Hey, get back to work, you know? Yeah. And that's where a lot of it checking the schedule in the GPS is check you know okay they sat here for this long and stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
So it'll it'll track it'll see like what the movements and stuff.

Daniel Vargas
Che So like I tell my guys it's a 30 minutes max like when it's especially a polar out of 30 minutes max as long as you're moving through the job site they're not gonna say something. But if you're just sitting still, not doing nothing to hear in the truck like this and they're gonna say something.

Chi Ejimofor
So these guys are pretty these guys are like moving and spraying all day. All day, like every ten to thirty minutes. Damn.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, and depending on the job site, if it's a bigger job site, I mean by the time they get spraying the other end, so they're just spraying the whole time.

Chi Ejimofor
How big is it? Oh 4,000 gallons. I mean, okay.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
They're just spraying all day long.

Daniel Vargas
And then when you're doing a lot wash, that 4,000 down tank, even with two guns on the side hose, takes you about 30, 40 minutes to drain. So you shouldn't have cocked it on a hose for 30 to 40 minutes, then he goes fills up for like 10 to 15 minutes.

Daniel Vargas
And they fill up on site? Yeah. Yeah we always gotta make sure we have when I do a lot wash, I make sure I talk to them, that's another thing actually, is water source Okay, do you have a water source on the job site?

Daniel Vargas
And then they say no and I'm like, well, I can't help you because I gotta be able to be close to be able to get water on site because I don't have nowhere to haul water for you. Well they still water.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, but if you're not a little bit more than a little bit of a water, so they need a water source on site.

Daniel Vargas
We're not just gonna water hydrant with a meter and a backfill on it. Because if you steal from a water hydrant that doesn't have a meter or a back roll on it, it's a $10,000 file
Chi Ejimofor
So they need a water source on on site and that w and that water source is always or usually a hydrant with a meter and a bag source.

Daniel Vargas
Or it might be you know they might have a hydrant with a water meter and back wheel but it's hooked up to a water tower so you can just drive underneath it and fill the touchdown preferred
Chi Ejimofor
But and nine most of the time they have a water source. Okay. But you do ask, you're like, hey, you got a water source.

Daniel Vargas
Yeah, then if they don't then I try to if they say no we don't I'm like, hey, you know well. Let me see what I can do, find out neighboring job sites. I'll call then see if we can borrow some water. Well we'll okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So you will it's not like it's not the end, you're not you're not like you're not gonna let it stop, but you'll be like, yeah, I'll see my ask around.

Daniel Vargas
And if there's not nothing I can do for you, I'll give you a couple contacts to call for other companies. Maybe they might be able to help you out. But I don't want to take the chance
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, because you gotta I mean you can you can't like I guess you can't go to a I don't know the nearest hydrant and you can't okay No, no. It's a specific it has to be on the site.

Chi Ejimofor
So because they own it or something? Yeah. So they regulate the amount of water they put.

Daniel Vargas
But they have contacted the site city and have them put their water meter on it that's calculating the gallons incoming alpha hydro.

Chi Ejimofor
And okay. And so if there's a nearby water site that would help they would just like charge you they would like charge you I don't know.

Daniel Vargas
I mean they would either or I would work something out with them. I've done where it's like hey you know give us this and I'll do a couple pass of water hit for you for free. Okay, so it's give and take in and out. And I always try to I make sure I talk to Tim before I authorize anything like that because At the end of the day I don't have the authorization to just be throwing money away for the company.

Chi Ejimofor
Right. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
So you have to make sure you have to make sure it's all I okay to offer these hours on this or you know
Chi Ejimofor
Let's make sure everything evens out. Okay.

Daniel Vargas
Now is there times where we pull up to the job site and the super's like just get it done? And we're like, okay, you're telling us to take that water though, so if someone shows up, it's on you. Get it done.

Daniel Vargas
Okay. Well you'll sign the ticket then.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so if you do take if you see like a water thing, you're like, you know what's going on and they're like Yeah. Then you're like, okay, well we'll we'll do it, but it is your call.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, it's your call and you and you're taking the risk and it's on you. Yeah. It's not on us. We're not taking any.

Daniel Vargas
Because you told us to do it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. There's no ri I mean has it ever I mean I guess never never been a thing, yeah. Never been a problem.

Daniel Vargas
Now I've definitely back before my time heard of situations where guys got pulled up on by a city inspector and they're sitting there at a hydro filling the water truck up with nothing on it. Like, what the fuck are you gonna do?

Daniel Vargas
What the hell is going on? And they're like, uh You gotta ask my boss.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah, of course.

Daniel Vargas
You know, I'm not gonna yeah so but then City usually just hits in the warming and it's like hey I fish it off.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh okay. And the desk I don't know. Uh I guess the random I mean desk permit stuff that's like before you you don't care about that. It's not your business.

Daniel Vargas
No, no, no, no, no, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I think I got I think I got everything. Uh I guess the yeah the only other random yeah the only other random stuff I'll just I don't know whatever I guess I'll
Daniel Vargas
Look at uh I'll just look at work completes and stuff and just see what the hell comes a little bit of everything comes through water ramps, backflows, water dumpings.

Daniel Vargas
You mean Gorilla snot, which is kind of still dust control. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I think that's the that's the main thing that I was thinking of like there's I could probably get general I can get like I could probably get 80 to 90% of what happens here, but it seems like there's a lot of there's calls and emails and stuff that just happens that is just Outside of the thing and you only get I'd I'd probably only capture it after, you know, I don't know, three or four months of being around and just I probably wouldn't even count it maybe be longer because it's like but I can get the general stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
So they're yeah, so I guess the goal is just to get the general and then go from there.

Daniel Vargas
Like you said too, you're always playing right along throughout the week then
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, because I'm you know um yeah I'm just I think my main yeah the main thing is I'm trying to get with the uh I need to Kendrick didn't did she message me back Yeah, I think I oh she messed she did tomorrow would work.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, she did message me back. I didn't get that. I didn't get that thing. Yeah, I'll probably meet with her tomorrow. Yeah.

Daniel Vargas
She'll probably be uh she ran everything, dude. She was
Chi Ejimofor
the powerhouse around here can you yeah I was gonna say I was like I think I I got like so much information just from talking to Don yesterday I was like I'm more or less like after Don I was like I'm more or less going to the the delivery guys and just kinda confirming stuff but that of course you guys give what uh or you're the f first one I'm really talking to but you give a a lot more context but I have like a shell so I'm more You know, I have some basis, I'm not just come starting from scratch.
