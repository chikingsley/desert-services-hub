# Dawn Wagner Transcript

Dawn Wagner
Daniel gets a lot of the calls for water truck and says, hey, we need a lot wash here, we need a lot wash there. Um can we have a quick dust control there? And then he'll tell me and I'll put it.

Dawn Wagner
in yellow like right here this one a guy named Fred called in SW means um street sweeping so this guy if it had wt on here it means
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
That's how you should street sweeping work. This here, all this yellow, this means that this Saunders Kia, they're on schedule for water truck. Okay.

Dawn Wagner
Um Suntec street sweeping They um send by email would they want all their hits um scheduled.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
They email it. I'm just trying to get no no get overall, yeah, yeah. Um
Chi Ejimofor
They'll email it they'll email when they and then he'll put it on the schedule and you also see it and then that's what you mean by that or yeah like for example I get email
Dawn Wagner
Like I gotta log all these this shit in.

Chi Ejimofor
This is all today.

Dawn Wagner
Mm-hmm. And yesterday.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
I ranged from probably 75 to 150 emails a day So if you tell me to do something, don't keep asking me. I will do it.

Dawn Wagner
Don't send me another fucking email. I'll probably walk over. Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
I'll put it right here where where Ava put Ava puts her stuff.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah. Yeah. Um we're there. Okay. So Suntec here. They want, which this is a new project just looking at it. They email me and Kelly and Kendra because um she likes to be attached to stuff so she knows what's going on.

Dawn Wagner
So what I would do is take this but I'm pretty sure that this is a brand new project. don't recall it. So but a double check because I have missed it, you know.

Dawn Wagner
I added it a few times, added stuff a few times Oh, see?

Dawn Wagner
I don't recall it, but it here it is. We I added it not too long So I go and find the day. Suntec is very annoying.

Dawn Wagner
Just saying.

Chi Ejimofor
So they said 1023

Dawn Wagner
Okay, here they want this 1023 and I have to bill it by this PO.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
Every one of these hits I have to send a separate invoice for separate PO. Okay, so this hit I pasted in here so when I go to bill it I know to use that PO for that date.

Dawn Wagner
Anything in yellow, it means It's scheduled. And if it's not hit, I ask Kelly. Kelly Kelly, what's happening? Why didn't we hit this hit?

Chi Ejimofor
So that's anything so we repeat that anything so this this is at 1023. So that would be the Friday night?

Dawn Wagner
Oh yeah, good catch. Yeah, so that'll be Friday, and they wanted a certain hint, certain times. So but sometimes Kelly can't do that.

Chi Ejimofor
So she'll change the color of it when it's done?

Dawn Wagner
No, when I do when I change the color of it There's like this one like this somebody hit this honor health site for 50 minutes so I hit um.

Dawn Wagner
50s w which is street sweeping And then I undo it white. Same with this one. Same with that one. I uncolor it. Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
So he basically didn't get these two or they were cancel but sometimes they cancel a lot they reschedule a lot they move a lot so I just leave it alone because Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So you just leave it there and then I don't know, just reschedule. So anything that's I guess it's green, it's nothing, or it it actually did happen, cool. If it didn't happen, you just leave it and then just
Dawn Wagner
scheduled or whatever. So that's how I get street sweeping kits for Suntec
Chi Ejimofor
So it's just like you get it you get emails slash maybe some text or something
Dawn Wagner
or whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And you'll keep that, but you'll keep that in your yeah I put it in Kelly.

Dawn Wagner
I have it in Kelly's file. I've got a folder for Kelly, Daniel. Eventually you'll have your own folder Um, because it's easier for me to search. Yeah, yeah. I can just go to the department or whoever it is, like Jeff and Jerry It is estimating Jason inspectors that's uh then back here.

Dawn Wagner
I just have my own folder so if I gotta know directly, I don't have to search my whole damn email. I just go to that folder and then type it. what they want. Um but another way I get um requests is if for some reason Kelly misses his phone Call or Daniel misses his phone um it goes to this answering service so this um Dylan he wants a street sweeping Um he doesn't oh he wanted it today.

Dawn Wagner
But I have to wait for Kelly to respond to see if he actually did it And they're pretty good about saying, hey, did you get this? Did you see this?

Dawn Wagner
Did you schedule this? Because they want they want a response They want to respond.

Chi Ejimofor
So that person will follow up.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, whoever this desert unwinds their answering service, they'll follow up.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay
Dawn Wagner
So um same thing with water truck. I'll get some of these with hey we want a lot wash down here da da da da da so this here I'd go into AP Global Because a lot of customers like um to know who requested it because there's so many people on site and it's just good backup for me so I was like hey no this Dylan Q re ordered the street sweeping sleeping and they're like oh okay or um this guy might not work for AP Global he could be working for Suntec and I'm like well that's Suntec And I'm like, well, he gave the wrong information.

Dawn Wagner
So AP Global is responsible for it. It just this is backup for me.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah
Dawn Wagner
So I'll go and we hit this one a lot and we do a lot of lot washes on this one. So there's QT14 four sides.

Dawn Wagner
They wanted a street sweeping today. So I turn it yellow.

Chi Ejimofor
Just as an expectation for something.

Dawn Wagner
And I go SW because it's for street sweeping If it was for water truck, it'd be WT
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
And then I put the guy if I have any issues getting the paid or getting it whatever. I have their phone number and I have their um email address.

Chi Ejimofor
And if I ever have to research it, then you type you just search their phone number.

Dawn Wagner
This one will be in Kelly. Same with um Daniel.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
So I was gonna show you um street sweeping We do we are on schedule for a lot of people for street sweeping
Chi Ejimofor
Is this um is this only yours or is this everybody that bills
Dawn Wagner
Oh no, it says with WT and okay, so this is just this is just water truck, street sweeping pressure washing, and construction cleanup.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
It is on SharePoint Um the only time that anybody um really messes with it is Kendrick has anything in blue is what?

Chi Ejimofor
It is invoice.

Dawn Wagner
Contract billing.

Chi Ejimofor
Contract, the opposite.

Dawn Wagner
Contract billings. So like this one here. Um for Westpac Textura. I have to create the invoice if there's any hits, and then I email Kendra and say invoice ready for Westpac Park 11.

Dawn Wagner
And then she'll when she gets the invite for To bill against in texture, she'll go and bill that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, and then they there's separate B's for Uh for since there's two of the things combined, there's at least three of these Excel's for maybe.

Dawn Wagner
I'm the old school one.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. What do they oh they use QuickBooks?

Dawn Wagner
No. Um Porta John and Roloff use Krill
Chi Ejimofor
They use core for the crow for billing.

Dawn Wagner
They use crow for scheduling and completing the Oh is this a sched this is a s
Chi Ejimofor
Well he okay okay okay I'm trying to push it up schedule and uh this is a schedule but he d he he has a paper schedule but you put this on this schedule because this is the schedule for you to understand I from my understanding the guy writes down um some stuff on paper.

Dawn Wagner
This is Kelly's work complete.

Chi Ejimofor
No I'm not saying I didn't say anything.

Dawn Wagner
I'm just I know what you're thinking.

Chi Ejimofor
I like to smile.

Dawn Wagner
I think it every I think every time I see a it works, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
But it's no
Dawn Wagner
So this is Kelly's work in place. So he takes calls and he'll write them down. So if you see like here's some Suntec ones, the PO ending in 3911 on 72 and Shea.

Dawn Wagner
This is how he keeps track of it. And then waste management. We're on schedule. We have a schedule. Um this is what we hit for waste management.

Chi Ejimofor
So up here at the top he's got uh met Kelly what does he have a beard?

Dawn Wagner
You have not met Kelly.

Logan Campbell
You might not.

Dawn Wagner
You might not ever.

Chi Ejimofor
Is he a home guy?

Dawn Wagner
He he works at home. Um I've seen him three times. Let's just say I from I've worked here for six years.

Dawn Wagner
Oh. The first five years I only saw him one time. Since Tim has owned it, I've seen him three times.

Chi Ejimofor
Thank you.

Dawn Wagner
First time he just came strolling in, I'm like, who's the in the hell is this homeless person in here? And then Jeff happened to start talking to him and I was like, oh. And then I recognized the voice and I'm like, ah, it's Kelly.

Chi Ejimofor

Okay, so at the end of the you'll so you'll have a basic you'll have a basic idea from everything that you've done and then you'll go back through and Yeah, what's the pro so you go back through you have time sh you have timesheets, then you have this, then you have whatever you put in there.

Chi Ejimofor
How does everything come together, I guess?

Dawn Wagner
all the timesheets here.

Chi Ejimofor
This is the master thing 'cause it's like phys you like work came through and we have a physical document.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, like somebody called and said they a core they wanted to hit on 17th Avenue and 202 Highway. Santan's on schedule. This one it's not on schedule, so I know somebody called that man.

Dawn Wagner

Dawn Wagner
So Pass, somebody called that one in. Iron Mountain, we're on schedule. Sand were on schedule. Butterfield on schedule.

Chi Ejimofor
And you know that just from you know that because of
Dawn Wagner
Yeah, these are all waste management sites. So you'll you'll get this.

Chi Ejimofor
So this is the master does does this Like is this just for your record or what do you do?

Dawn Wagner
Do you do anything with this? This one I do do with it because I have to have certain POs, so like if I look at it Um Elr LR Colwin right here.

Dawn Wagner
I have to build this one, the site with a PO of 533513. I have to build it with the um PO on the invoice. Um this one uh Correti mix I have to fill this one with the PO.

Dawn Wagner
All the Suntec I have to build with PO. So I just have to watch on here. and see if there's any kind of POs. And then um with all of our new sales guys we've been getting new customers and stuff.

Dawn Wagner

Chi Ejimofor
Email, send a dual email, two people on there. If if so if a customer, there's swiping all that stuff, but if the customer says, hey, I need a water truck, hey, I need this
Dawn Wagner

Chi Ejimofor
So Kelly is the director, just not the title. Yeah, yeah, okay. He's that's the thanks for that question.

Dawn Wagner

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I'm calling him a director.

Dawn Wagner
Huh? He still sweets? No. I thought he had one up there.

Chi Ejimofor
What's his last name? Kelly Wood?

Dawn Wagner
Klein. K-L-I-N-E.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm calling him a director. I'm done And you're and you and your billing for both of those guys. Okay.

Dawn Wagner
For Daniel water truck and Kelly street sweeping Daniel pressure washing, Daniel construction cleanup.

Chi Ejimofor
Daniel.

Dawn Wagner
Daniel extra stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Dan P pressure wash, okay.

Dawn Wagner
No, Daniel You say Daniel uh Daniel B, yeah. I talked to him for a while, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Dan V he does he does the water truck, he does the pressure washing because that's using water trucks
Dawn Wagner
No.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, it uses water inside of the little whatever thing.

Logan Campbell
So water truck can do lot washes, but they're actual pressure washers for high pressure cleanings.

Dawn Wagner
It's a truck that Travis and Chase got into when the one that was Reggie was standing Fixing. Yeah, yeah. And they're like, can we take this now? And they climbed in it and left your street.

Logan Campbell
Yeah, that one's low pressure cleaning and high pressure cleaning.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, they are both. Uh okay, so Dan water truck. We have I'm gonna put some blue back.

Chi Ejimofor
Which includes what? Backflow?

Dawn Wagner
We don't want to confusion yet. We don't want to confuse. It's not coming back.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm just gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna leave on the weekend and be like all right send an email hey guys let's what Jen did yeah that's what Jennifer did which one he went home and then emailed
Dawn Wagner
Jennifer was a very nice one. What was her role? What was her job? She was um the one's assistant to help us I was very commentative or I told her I didn't want to. She went three days to increase. She's young?

Dawn Wagner
My age, she's my age.

Chi Ejimofor
But she's just like, yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, she's like she's like I'm done. This is overwhelming.

Logan Campbell
I think some people don't understand like the variety and that variety makes this unique. Whatever job you're doing here will be unique. Because of unless you're doing one specific thing.

Logan Campbell
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Which we never do. Okay, what do you got for Daniel?

Chi Ejimofor
I have Dan, water truck, a and something called backwash and then I have also presswash He's like spitting into a I don't know if he's drinking after meters of backflows.

Chi Ejimofor
Back flows, okay Okay.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, that is more swift, so take that off. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Take that off.

Dawn Wagner
But just I'll leave.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I'm just Going for it.

Dawn Wagner
Take off black flow.

Chi Ejimofor
You do billing for Dan, water trucks, Dan pressure wash, and then you do also billing for Kelly street sweeping
Dawn Wagner
Um, but like Logan's there's a lot to deal with with water truck, but backflows is Sweat.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. But you do you do billing for this?

Dawn Wagner
Sometimes.

Chi Ejimofor
Not but that's not on here.

Dawn Wagner
I'm not going here.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. I'm just talking.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah. But underneath Daniel, we do flow testing. It's part of water truck. It's different pricing.

Chi Ejimofor
It's just another thing. Okay.

Dawn Wagner
We'll talk about pricing later later. So they do perk testing, flow testing. For water trucks.

Chi Ejimofor
Say part testing?

Dawn Wagner
PERK. P-E-R-K. Testing. It's like something like they fill up wells.

Logan Campbell
So the dry wells that are punched on construction sites to certify the drywall you have to flow a certain amount of water through it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Logan Campbell
So in an hour you have to flow like 3,000 gallons of water. So it's a specific service that we help out with.

Chi Ejimofor
Perk testing.

Dawn Wagner
Perk testing, flow testing. We've um fail swimming pools. There's this one cup here like once a year.

Dawn Wagner
I mean And then we fill um the um the tanks for um the construction uh what are they called water tanks? Yeah is that the W No I bill it with water trucks.

Dawn Wagner
Okay. He's like, don't make me work with that no more.

Logan Campbell
This company is made of five different companies that don't touch each other except for all of the times that they do touch each other.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Okay, so that's pretty much what Water Truck does on a weekly basis.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So people call people uh so people Um well these so so this guy's getting hit. I mean Kelly and Dan in general are getting hit from the outside mostly And all and they get a some some inside con some stuff.

Dawn Wagner
No, because now um with the answering service it um it pretty much comes Yeah.

Logan Campbell
How it was for a long time when some of the customers are used to you they would go direct to the supervisor slash director. That's how it has been for a long time. So some of the leads do come direct on a call to the director.

Dawn Wagner
I would say at least 80% of our major superintendents has um Daniels and Kelly's phone number so they call him them directly or they text him And if they for some reason don't answer the phone, that's when this answering service comes about Because I guess we did attended some kind of research or whatever and we were missing thousands of calls.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's interesting. And in general, I guess they're they're making an attempt to have salespeople kind of also in that thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Um to so sales people will also get calls and in the future best case scenario, beautiful world. Uh these guys will probably still be getting calls because of legacy, but then uh you'll also have the uh the salespeople getting calls and in this world then the salespeople would be shooting that over to the directors and you and then that'll be so and then you basically have the two forms of input from the sales and then from the direct and then okay.

Logan Campbell
Back in the day it was three calls. If you wanted a dumpster, you wanted a Portageon and you needed a water truck, that's three different things.

Chi Ejimofor
You have to call three different guys here.

Dawn Wagner
Unless they unless they called in to us and then we would just write up an email and tag everybody to it who is necessary because that was putting that poor person into calling three different people and that was that necessary.

Dawn Wagner
So we would do a one email sent in on to that person.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Involved.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, that's fun. That's fun.

Logan Campbell
Yeah, eventually if we can have like an inbound line directly to a scheduler, yeah, that's and a handle all over it That would be interesting.

Dawn Wagner
Well that's what the ensemble service is kinda doing.

Logan Campbell
There are ten to be able to integrate them with each director's schedule.

Chi Ejimofor
I was going to say it would be interesting for that. Yeah, because I was going to say like I mean I well I don't know it depends on what system it is but like there's no reason why some like I don't know I look at the Mondays Mondays Monday but for example somebody could get a call like there's no reason not answering lady they're not they're not dumb they could write down the thing into Monday and like it's good.

Chi Ejimofor
In fact I think they do. Or I don't know if I don't know if they do or I don't know if I don't know if estimate I don't know if he puts it in by himself. But I know he follows up on the calls in Mon using Monday I guess.

Dawn Wagner
Um I don't use Monday.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that's probably then he puts it in on his own uh and then tracks it that way.

Dawn Wagner
I don't use Monday.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
I don't know what that is.

Chi Ejimofor
It's probably good to be honest.

Dawn Wagner
Yes. I don't need another system.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. You know, yeah. Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Okay, so basically it'll come from the act the superintendents to the supervisors and then I get it. And then if it's internal um salespeople um to Daniel and Kelly with me attached After I stopped my feet about 20 times.

Chi Ejimofor
And and the I mean these guys it sounds like I mean it sounds like estimating they I don't know they get a contract and it might have some something it might have one of those things on there and then in that case they would all in that case if they get a contract in they would also they would send that contract and CC
Dawn Wagner
The directors with whoever's involved with it. The directors basically pick through the contracts.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, they picked yeah, so okay. Not ideal, but currently they pick through it to find out if they're if they're involved. Right. But in another thing that we need to make So there's technically three like sources, but this the internal one for you guys is the least, maybe Like the internal internal uh contracts from you know the one SW SWIP projects is the the lowest amount of leads directly to you guys.

Dawn Wagner
Well that one is um that contract email goes to everybody just really in internal. Yeah.

Logan Campbell
It can have everything. It can have water trucks, it can have switch install, swiping inspections.

Dawn Wagner
It has the whole contract.

Logan Campbell
The whole scope of whole contract for that. So that's why it goes to everybody.

Chi Ejimofor
So it goes to everybody. So like uh this this guy uh Kelly, he does look at that?

Dawn Wagner
It does not go to Kelly, it just goes to us in the office.

Logan Campbell
you don't know how much mess you're gonna make.

Dawn Wagner
That's why we are starting to do contract for street sweeping Mm-hmm.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he's he's he's chilled by himself. So for him he it's just it's just two sources. Yeah. For for water truck it could it's could be three. And two.

Dawn Wagner
And then usually um what I've seen happening is Uh whatever salesperson is in charge of that contract, they let Daniel know, hey, we're going on schedule for water truck or whatever.

Dawn Wagner
on this contract like GCON we're going on schedule and that what I wasn't aware of until um I was informed yesterday
Chi Ejimofor
By who?

Dawn Wagner
By Brandon. And then I found out yesterday too that um were we're not at WD anymore for eight hours a day because they ran out of money on the contract.

Dawn Wagner
And I was like, well I might still have them on schedule. And when did this come about?

Chi Ejimofor
That's from uh Brand okay that's from Brandon. Okay.

Logan Campbell
Are you gonna be sorting through contracts?

Chi Ejimofor
That's what the that is one of the that was one of the ideas on the beg at the very you know.

Logan Campbell
Like this is what this
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that was one of the things is like it's going through it's contract there's contract review like making sure there's no weird stuff in it, but then there's the extra piece of the initiation like well, you know, who needs what you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Who yeah, who needs what and then even like are there any free qualifications that I don't know one of the teams needs to know about to be ready for? Uh yeah, so we don't find out the day before. Exactly.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh we need a hard hat. You need OSHIX logs or something.

Logan Campbell
Um okay, that's uh I know a student inspector would love to just get an email Hey, this site we're supposed to install this day.

Dawn Wagner
Well I think that's what eventually he's gonna be doing.

Logan Campbell
Because right now we dig through contracts, but the vast majority of our day is spent out of office So it's so easy to miss. Or you just you see an estimate and you're like, well, I'm gonna throw it in just in case.

Logan Campbell
And then you get five inspections in. And they don't take inspections. Pretty easy to do. Yeah. Because I figure it's better to start them and let's waste a little bit of time instead of miss them.

Logan Campbell
But then that means that sometimes we go, oh. Stuff like that, I think, is where having that bridge will be fantastic.

Chi Ejimofor
And you guys, uh Jason helps you guys with the schedule or do you guys we're like a side thought.

Logan Campbell
His his most is the stall Yeah. And then sometimes they'll tuck in there like that they're gonna get in switches because sometimes that's not entirely important.

Logan Campbell
You know, or sometimes not tucked in there. So We basically have to pick a piece from a standard contract or PCL to figure out what what sites we're starting and when we're actually starting.

Logan Campbell
Because we try to follow the install.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So you guys, yeah, so you so you have you also have uh you said, well, we'll have this probably you'll be in tomorrow. Uh Probably not. Okay.

Logan Campbell
Coming in a little bit in the afternoon, but I gotta get out of here early tomorrow.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So are you leaving right now? Yeah. Okay. We'll probably so but the three you said the three s you have to you said his email.

Logan Campbell
Uh his email is some crumbs. The contract is great. Some of these contracts are part of Pilver through. And then we get a lot of investments, but sometimes it's not A confirmed estimate.

Logan Campbell
Sometimes it's just the initial.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And you guys are seeing do you guys use Monday or what are how are you guys seeing estimates? You guys are seeing it sent out? Sent in an email in the contracts email basically. Okay.

Logan Campbell
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Fun fun.

Logan Campbell
Whenever we install like Bs and stuff on site, we're supposed to do first inspection within 14 days. So hitting that 14-day period for the start. Sometimes the start gets pushed back or we just don't have the info.

Logan Campbell
Depends we know two inspections, they technically rather compliance.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah But we So you really so you guys really need uh I mean, i ideally like you like for everything that comes through, you need a we need a start date.

Chi Ejimofor
You need a start date and then you guys can do it. You need to know the wins and you need to know start date. Yeah. And then you need to have communication. Communication. Yeah.

Logan Campbell
Frequency of inspection. There's two frequencies, seven day and almost nobody does.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Logan Campbell
And 14 day. 98% do that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Logan Campbell
And this is the day it needs to start. This day or within two weeks. Okay. So that's if we can pluck that, that makes us way more efficient. So if you're already digging through a contract and you're able to just fire off that From a contract?

Logan Campbell
It seems that's a huge amount.

Dawn Wagner
Alright, let's get it. So you can give a snap.

Chi Ejimofor
And then and then the uh and then the uh salesperson Yeah and like make sure that they can keep you on.

Logan Campbell
As soon as we're doing install. Yeah. Or sooner. Yeah. So they need that. They have install Hank. And so we know and then like water truck.

Dawn Wagner
You'll have your time. You're wasting my hour. Keep going on
Chi Ejimofor

Dawn Wagner

Dawn Wagner
This is the how Jared sends over the contracts. Um this is who's all listed on the contracts. Or it doesn't It doesn't list but anybody internal office so we got this contract, but it's not for red plane Um so he sends that out to everybody and then once we get it everybody knows what they have to do as far as getting insurance certs, um, getting them on schedule.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah just do do do do do.

Chi Ejimofor
So is this like did he like take a template and not change the thing or what why would that not have the right um thing on it Is that because it's like a template or something or like a copy?

Chi Ejimofor

Dawn Wagner
Or um yeah, uh Jared. Jared did the
Chi Ejimofor
So this is the estimate?

Dawn Wagner
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So the estimate just doesn't have the right um so it's probably like just a quick like copied or something and just didn't change that thing. Probably. Is that typical? I mean it's it happens. I mean if it happens, I usually you know, that's the uh I'm not stepping on any, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Can I c uh can I click on that? You I don't want to click is there a quick way that you okay. Okay, so this is just I mean so yeah basically yeah that's but so there was um I came across this

Dawn Wagner
Yeah. He wants me to do a prequel and I was just like, so I asked him I replied and asked him I'm like hey do you want the certs under this company or do you want it under redpoint he's like no everything's under this company So I updated QuickBooks and let Kendra, Jason, everybody know that this contract is actually for Kendoff and not Red Point.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so it just has that communication hasn't reached everywhere that it needed to be.

Dawn Wagner
No, this morning it already did because I knew I had to do a pre-quall on it. So I fixed it all this morning
Chi Ejimofor

Dawn Wagner
And he's like, hey Don, can you send over a W9? Um, and then he wants you to do a pre-call. Who's the best person? So then when I looked at here I was it was like well that don't really match red point okay and then this one here I'm like that don't match so I was just like hey question just to make sure You know, or because I was doing the entrance search, is it under Red Point or is it under this?

Dawn Wagner

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. If I end up.

Dawn Wagner
So I went in because I the the best source of um getting things paid and if you ever have any problems When you get any kind of signature line of any sort, you try and get as much possible in here as you can.

Dawn Wagner
And you always attach where it's coming from. like all the information from this morning if you open it up I attached all the confirmation of what it is and um the correct information
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um is it do estimates get connected to this in some way?

Dawn Wagner
Or contracts get connected to this uh Yes, you always can you always um once you get the contract back Which Kendra will train you that. Um so right here, any attachments usually the um contracts are attached to this to the project.

Chi Ejimofor
So they attach right now they attach they just they just attach the email that has the contract on it. Okay so it's right.

Dawn Wagner
Well no that one is um this one we were having problems getting something paid So that's not the contract. So explain one.

Dawn Wagner
Before leave. West Park. This one should have one. This one we Just job we've gone forever and ever and ever. Um but when you attach a contract It goes on the project itself.

Dawn Wagner
Which it's not.

Chi Ejimofor
See on the project this is a pro This is the project.

Dawn Wagner
See yeah, if you look at um look how many this um So okay, so it's under one company but that you have like set mm six different projects or something like that. Yeah, yeah. So when we get a contract you want to make sure it's under the right project like Slim Chickens Vidir you want to make sure that has the right contract under it so right here's the subcontract So everything's attached right here.

Dawn Wagner
So if you have any kind of issues or anything like that, that's where we can go back and say, hey, you know, any kind of like if they're not paying the contract She usually has a little more emails and stuff like that.

Dawn Wagner
And if there's any ever questions, we have a contract to go back on.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah Okay, let's go.

Dawn Wagner
So the contract needs to go on the project.

Chi Ejimofor

Chi Ejimofor
Yes, I think so. And then yeah, and then it gets a um okay.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, I think I have like a and this is work out a tiny bit. This is Daniel's work complete This is for 10-6. This is how it is. Water truck.

Chi Ejimofor
So he's he's uh you know um he does email
Dawn Wagner
Mm-hmm. Because he doesn't like his writing and Well I don't yeah, I mean writing is wild. Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean at least yeah, I mean at least you know I I can read writing, you know. I mean all the time of course. Yeah. So if what is okay. And what are so what's Mick's a driver?

Dawn Wagner
Robert, he works he's a uh water truck driver, but he works with Swift Crew to drive um Um he's got a CDL here.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he'll just he basically so he'll just say like this guy's working SWIP this week, basic or that day or something.

Dawn Wagner
And then he'll do lot washes and stuff like that. And another thing you add under Daniel. Daniel is a fill-in for the slope crew.

Dawn Wagner
Daniel's your kind of do-it-all guy. So if any um if Dalton's sick or whatever and they need uh rock entrances they need you know who get his hands dirty um it's daniel yeah nice yeah um daniel does a lot of stuff with foot so all these work completes that I get from Daniel, I have to send these to Kendra and Jason.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
Because they handle the switch.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah. So they covered their billing.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh Jason does billing?

Dawn Wagner
Jason is schedules, he schedules the
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah, that's what I was gonna say. So he but you sent you send it okay.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah Jason is this is Jason's schedule he sends out to everybody every day um each day he does a schedule So this one here um they need a dust permit they need a desk permit desk permit um right here parkway construction they're gonna get it entrance tomorrow rock entrance um they getting rock delivered so he's like really talking to these guys like yeah you know this is what he This is how he schedules.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So he's really okay, so technic so the delivery people are are pretty are in contact with the customer T usually. Um I guess not not yeah, I mean I guess all of them.

Dawn Wagner
Jason, yeah. And then once Jason gets it on schedule and confirms everything, he sends that out.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Dawn Wagner
And then what happens is um this is what Kendra goes off her contract billing 'Cause she does the swim billing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And she builds month everybody bills monthly. Um And and at the end at the same time every month or just monthly depending on the con everybody.

Dawn Wagner
Okay, street sweeping and water truck I have to wait till the end of the month.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
Well actually kind of the second week, first second week of the following month because I'm always a week kind of two weeks behind on time timesheets.

Dawn Wagner
Like for example, this is weekending the twelfth. So I'm working on this week.

Chi Ejimofor
Is that because is that is that uh because of the amount of time it takes to yeah what why is uh because um
Dawn Wagner
Like the timesheets for the 19th, they don't get turned in till the 20th. And then by the time payroll and They go through them and everything.

Dawn Wagner
See ya. Um they try by the time they get it through and process and everything, I usually get them the twenty
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So like for example so in the in magical new world that may exist in the near future with the digital stuff then it would theoretically be quicker because the you get the timesheets every day.

Dawn Wagner
We're hoping. Yeah, and daily. We'd get their times and hits daily.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So that should so if that if that were the so right now it's like one to two weeks delayed. If that were the case, would it it would be exactly at the end of the month?

Dawn Wagner
I I mean it's uh it's based on it's based on what you yeah, okay.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean if you're double one one or if you're if you were a day or two behind you would just do the next week at the end of the week or something on Friday?

Dawn Wagner
Well if like say um Like their timesheets here, they got everything here. I wouldn't get in get in until the third, which I could get all the hits in, and then I could probably start building that first week
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Dawn Wagner
But how it is now I wouldn't actually be able to start building until more like the six.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Dawn Wagner
But once I've getting them daily, then I can do the hits, you know. But I don't know if I'm gonna still be using a spreadsheet either. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
What I was gonna say like what yeah, I was gonna say what happens. Yeah, what yeah, that's an interesting thing. Uh how did uh do you have does it do they give I guess you like trial it a little bit. Do they have like an online little portal thing that just shows you the the whatever it is?

Dawn Wagner
Well me and Daniel were involved with the choice of what we got. Let me tell her.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. You got a problem.

Dawn Wagner
Hey, I'll call you back in the flu. I'm working with uh Mr. Yeah. Okay, um we were the one me and Daniel are kind of was involved in choosing the system we got because of all the per to it and how it worked um but I haven't got to touch it since we bought it okay I know that most of the leads are.

Dawn Wagner
