# James Neal Transcript

James Neal
sequential beats basically so all of my ten ones are gonna be right here and then all my ten two so this is just when so when I print so first you want to you want to sharepoint And then so SharePoint and then location upload main master and that's our main file for all of our For all of our inspections.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so all these inspections are in this everybody.

James Neal
So that's Herbie's, that's Logan, that's everybody's all of our projects are in here Um and then what I do is sort and filter. I go to custom sort. And I sort it as last inspection. So tomorrow what I'll do. Tomorrow what I'll do is I'll go through and I'll change all of these dates and last inspection and I'll change it to um and you know what what I have done already. So like um You know, for example, like all of these, she already changed all of her, but like all of these I'll change, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
So basically move this column over Exactly.

James Neal
I don't ever mess with next inspection because that is where they have um that's where the formula it is and so whenever for some reason if you missed mess with that column I've been instructed don't touch that column so I don't but yes basically what I do is I I just Just you know turn transpose the dates. So my 1013 Um will go into last inspection. So I this is kind of a way that I can check to make sure that I've got I've done what I needed to do, you know, where it's like, okay, I'm going through and I'm looking and I'm saying busy bees daycare levine I'm changing to 1013 for the last inspection Um and I can like cross-reference, you know, at this point I know I've hit everything because 1013 it was raining two inches and I have hit every single one of my So after we've got it uh sorted and filtered, we
Chi Ejimofor
So the filter is by person, I guess?

James Neal
Filter is by uh okay it's uh custom sort we found some data next to your selection you want to expand oh wait I see what's gone this is the problem so you gotta highlight everything and then Yeah, so you can do it by anything. You can do it by inspector, you can do it by company name, job detail, all of that stuff. So I could Sort it might be.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you're not filtering it, you're just like you it's called it's called sort and filter, but it's you're just doing sort by inspector.

James Neal
Yes, that's what I am doing and then I usually go sort by inspector name and then last inspection and what that does is that makes everybody's everybody's inspections All done by date. So as per the last inspection that you did. So after I have that, what I'll do is I'll file and I'll create a copy and I'll download a copy of it. And then once that copy is in my downloads I pull it off my desktop. Let it hang out over here and then usually what I'll do is I'll close this down just because the next format Obviously this is a copy of that and I don't ever want to like mess around with the master because that fucks everything up so I always get it out get rid of it so that I don't have to mess with it. Um then we have to select enable editing. What do you do on the number here? Okay, so we do enable editing. Um And from that point, come down here to our scan folder. Then I go to the SWIPMAST here. Then I go to master Master inspection report print. Okay. It's crazy. Then this comes up.

Chi Ejimofor
So this is a template or something?

James Neal
So basically what I what how I see this is that I created this copy from our system. Now I can work off of my copy and I'm not working off of our system.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Neal
Because the issue was is that that first initial system got hacked in there If there was an issue in it. So it's basically the old system talking the new system. As as I see it.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean there's probably a lot more technical if Yeah, so this so we have uh the file these files on the computer.

James Neal
So you just opened up a I just opened up master inspection report print.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

James Neal
And that's just And that brings up this And so this is basically an inspection format. And so what I'll do is I go over here to mailings. And I go to start mail merge and I go to step-by-step mail merge wizard, which brings up this tab over here on the side. So it kind of gives you steps. The first step and second step, I go all the way to step three, and then I select routes. And I go over here to my desktop. If I'm doing this too fast for you, like I can slow down. I know you know I just kind of wanted to show you like the craziness of this Um and then I find my uploaded main master Wait is okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's uh okay, you you're not grabbing the the copy thing you're just gonna now I
James Neal
I brought it up here, but what I'm what I'm grabbing is the one that's it is this copy, but it's the one that I I just have stored on my desktop.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so we are grabbing that.

James Neal
Yes. Okay. And then this opens up select table. I scroll down to upload dollar sign. I always select the top one. I don't I don't know if the top or bottom one, if that matters. Then I select OK. I don't know know what this is so I just select okay then I go step three is write your letter step four is preview your letters and step Five to six is complete. So at this point, all of the letters are written. They've got the correct. Project name, they've got the correct dates, they've got all that stuff. So like this one happens to be Herbie, which she's already adjusted the date, that's why it's eleven five. already printed out hervey's but if we go to mine um let's see so mine starts at 67 it's at least one behind because of the header so 66 it's still like the old date 1013 but that's my first one kelly and fake busy bees and then so what I do is I would just I go finish and merge, print documents, all or I'm sorry, what I would deal with. You know, sixty-six to whatever um one thirty-nine And I select OK. Then I go to print properties and I go to Finishing and I ensure that it's uh single sided and I ensure that it's hole punched and then select okay and then I hit okay and if I were to do that right now it would print out about 84 inspections. But that is all that need, you know, it's a lot of steps.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah Okay. So basically it's it's it's taking that this is like some sort of template and it somebody did this male merge of no heard this.

James Neal
Yeah the Mail Merge wizard like this is a trick. Yeah, yeah, which I I appreciate it. I'm sure that there are ways to you know because like if you look at that header it's got this is like an old school way of doing this.

Chi Ejimofor
I was not because I we there's like you know there's like uh there's templates here
James Neal
You know.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean you can like take pieces of it and uh but this is like uh another form where I'm like, oh that's kinda cool. It's the same difference, yeah.

James Neal
So so Because it is, it's obviously it's taking the correct dates and it's due, it's doing all that for us. Like if we had to go through and write calleantic instructions some busy bees living you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Well yeah you have to have it it should has to be automated. Well it's it's has to be like automated. It's just an interesting method.

James Neal
I agree. Uh Never yeah. And then at that point, boom, I hit print and it's gonna print out uh 82 times three sheets So that's why that's that right there is all those are all the inspections that I've done.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Neal
Uh that stack. That's making it slowly getting better.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's basically the bigger steps make a copy of the master. You update it first. Update.

James Neal
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Update and then make a copy of the master schedule. And then Oh yeah, that's the main uh and then yeah that's the main the first part.

James Neal
And then main master, then
Chi Ejimofor
Um and then it's uh like do the mail filter and then you uh mail merge automation.

James Neal
Then you create that copy and save it to the desktop. Then you mail merge through our data file because remember I had to go to the data file and then you know it's I'm surprised I could actually sit here and explain it to you and do it without having to look. But at this point have done it enough. Honestly if I hadn't had so many rain events I probably wouldn't be as good at it. And this is to uh this is just to print out inspections. Print out inspections
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and this like schedule thing, I mean, i if if they was done mob in mobile in a mobile way, it it would still I guess you would still need to Yeah, yeah. At this point, Logan, you'd have to talk to Logan about that too. It's like what is in the official dealing with that because
James Neal
Uh uh as far as what I've seen from compliance go, you can schedule your inspection. It does all of basically what this does, it uploads all of the materials. the dates, the numbers, all of that stuff that you need, and then you set it on a schedule, whether it's 14 days or seven days or whatever. whatever it is and then it'll just reoccur from that point on. And then every 14 days you got your you know boom you're there, you got another one up ready to go. And so you know how to do it. So it it it sounds to me like the the digital format is going to cut out a lot of this. Um You know, I think at this point one of the reasons that we do this is for billing purposes because once Once we have a handwritten report, we scan it. So after I enclose this out. So after I've scanned my um after I scanned my inspections that I've done so like to use here these are two that I need to send to uh to good old Jim over at Mezzo. I go into the scan folder and they would usually be right here. I've already them out and I pull them over to my desktop then I will pull up my email And I will also pull out pull up SharePoint as well because the main master is where I've got all of my contact information as well so that contact information is transferred over here but it's just easier to you know for example find where it is highlight it and then I can copy his name or his email create the new email paste it there so now I know it's going to the right place. I put this little message in for people that haven't renewed their NOI yet, but I know Jim has. I make sure that this is the correct document, which it is. I rename this document 10 2025. And then I will drag it over here to upload it. I'll say subject is mezzo Uh Desert Ridge ten, twenty, twenty five and then I'll just send that one off then I have to come over here go into our projects folder Uh Mezzo is CSI construction projects A through M. Scroll down until I find CSI. Find mezzo select that and then I drag from my desktop to here so now it's in our data files that they can do billing and they're really good about this like if she literally emailed me today and was like of course Jen you know fucking regulation I don't know what it is. It's good.

Speaker 3
It's nice, I guess. I mean never mean you though.

James Neal
But at any rate, um, you know, they're Dawn Book Don and Kendra are really good about like she emailed me today and she was like hey pcds doesn't have a 1015 inspection in there because sometimes when I'm doing this so fast I'll delete it you know because after I'm up here I'll just delete
Speaker 3
this out and now it's gone because it's already in here.

James Neal
So there are times when I'll delete that prior to adding it to our billing file. And uh we can't bill it if you didn't there
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you're uh you're s wait I missed this. So you're scanning these into the computer. Okay.

James Neal
After I fill them out.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So you scan them one at a time?

James Neal
Mm-hmm. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, free sheets.

James Neal
Um which normally it's no problem. Like I do an average of I don't know. On my light week I'll do five or six a day. On my heavy weeks I'll do ten or twelve a day. So it's kind of back and forth. But yeah, I just when I go to scan it, I just take the three sheets and scan them one out at a time like one one report at a time so that when it gets to the scan file it's that full report and I pull it off my desktop and I go through
Chi Ejimofor
How long does it take to scan or I guess you do it ongoing? Every day. Okay. Every day.

James Neal
That's usually which like the idea of me having a a laptop was that I would be able to like not come to the office. and I could go home and scan it at home because I've got a printer with a scanner at home. The problem is that because I only have a laptop In order like you can see the benefit of having two screens.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, you kind of. You know what I mean?

James Neal
Whereas if I'm half screen on my email and half screen over here, this file itself is huge. You know, so in order for me to get to where like there's just it it it takes so much longer.

Speaker 3
Yeah.

James Neal
And it's like for my efficiency, one when I'm at home I got three kids clawed on me, so So it's difficult for me to get things to to be efficient. Yeah. So I just I I I've been since I started I've been just coming into the office daily and doing it um whereas if I was driving home I could get paid for my drive home and so it's kind of like that give or take but usually what I do is like I like I'll leave here whatever time I leave here and I usually add about another half hour to 45 minutes um on my time because when I get home um every day Um let's see. Every day Jason sends out an email that looks like this So this is the SWIP schedule. So every day I'll go through this when I get home. I'll respond to any emails. Well, you know, a lot of times I get maybe it's a high like an hour away so I'll get emails, I'll get phone calls, and I'm very diligent about responding to people right away. Um I feel like some some of the inspectors aren't. You know? But um like for me, like in the customer service side, like that being reactive because they're calling me because they helped and No matter what. They don't just call me sh shit. Like they're calling me because they need something and nine times out of ten when they need something from us they need it yesterday.

Speaker 3
Yeah.

James Neal
You know what I mean? So Um yeah, I'll go home and I'll check and I'll check that email.

Chi Ejimofor
They call they they do call you directly, but they also call Jason directly. They call whoever's they they have both of your numbers.

James Neal
Yes, yes. So it a lot of times it depends on the relationship. that they've developed. Some people, like when I did my uh my walk today with Tim, this guy, he's been in the construction industry in Arizona for over 20 years. So has Jason.

Speaker 3
Yeah.

James Neal
So he he knows Jason on a personal basis and he knows that Jason does the operations. He knows that he does the scheduling. He knows that it's gonna get taken care of if he calls Jason. I mean see how often he's on the phone all the fucking time. But there are times when they call me and they'll have like sometimes technical questions. Or it'll be like, hey, this happened, what should I do? Or like, how do you feel about this? Sometimes it's things that that Jason can't answer or that, you know, Jared can't answer. answer or whatever. So um but yeah I I get phone calls and emails all the time about random stuff. And so when I get home I usually spend about a half any work in a half hour, 45 minutes. And I go through this as well. And so this is the switch schedule for the next day. And it's got all of the dates, all of the customers, all of the project names, and this has as what needs to be done. And most of the time it'll say like this will be done by Jared, this will be done with Jared. But I go through this line by line, even though Less than half are my projects. I just like to know what's going on. Like I like to know where new projects are starting, even if it's not my my area I like to know that the project is starting if it's sometimes it's like oh I know that superintendent I I just I like to be knowledgeable yeah you know and if I know what's going on in company it's a better look for me as an authoritative take care.

Speaker 3
Yep I guess.

James Neal
So I go through this and usually what I look for is like this type of thing. I see here I don't think there's any wrong here, but I just look at the far right side when I'm trying to figure out Oh here I am. Thank you girl. Thank you. Welcome back. So I look for things like this. Swift inspections 21. No, granted this is in Glendale, so it's not gonna be my area. That's what I'm looking for because nobody tells us when we're getting a new project and when we have to start inspections.

Chi Ejimofor
That's up to us to look at the schedule and understand it or to even look further.

James Neal
understand it and see that we have inspections on that site. See? Swift inspections 21.

Chi Ejimofor
And then your name isn't on anything.

James Neal
Nope.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you put these in yourself?

James Neal
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
So you go to the master list.

James Neal
Like for example, uh let's see. So you this is what I do when I go through it.

Chi Ejimofor
Screenshot.

James Neal
I'll yeah, I'll just I'll copy it and then I'll email it to myself so the next day when I get in here I'll go okay cool this is because this is my job. So I I entered it today. So um what I'll do is so if it's an M T job If I don't if I just do it if I do it by company name lot easier because then it's in numerical alphabetic order. So like this is the the homestead at Lehigh Crossing Um so what I'll do is I'll go in and I'll copy a line from like MT from the And I'll copy that line and then I'll go down to the bottom here where it's empty and I'll paste it here and then I'll go and I'll change all the information information down here but the reason that I copy it is because it's got all of my information as well.

Chi Ejimofor
So this stuff get deleted out of here at some point.

James Neal
Yes, so So um this is what is called the uploads folder. When I'm done with a project I I will highlight the line and copy it, and then I'll go over to complete it, and I'll paste it in here, and then I'll delete it off the mask. And so these are all projects that have been completed. So right now we're over a thousand projects that we've completed.

Speaker 4
So wait, so how what is where is this?

James Neal
What is this uh this is just on the bottom tab down?

Speaker 4
Okay, so you just go to you so you basically copy it. Uh yeah, it's literally the same thing that you did before.

James Neal
I would paste it right here in the next one. And as you can see, like I've completed a lot of and this is just since
Chi Ejimofor
And you won't do it you just copy it and then just leave it. You don't have to do anything to it.

James Neal
Or you don't do anything.

Chi Ejimofor
You copy it here and then it's all good. You don't have to do anything else here and then you You just go back and delete the row.

James Neal
And then I delete the row. But prior to me closing out a project, what I do is I take my final inspection and when I email it to the GC, I copy Don. copy Kendra and then I also copy Daniel and Kelly because they do the final site cleanups and I put in my email Here's your final inspection. Place in section E of your SWIPT book. And if there's anything else that you need, we also offer site cleaning. We also offer street sweeping.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

James Neal
And I just see see those last two people because Daniel does the site clearing and and it actually worked. That was my idea.

Chi Ejimofor
And you started doing that recently. When did you start doing that?

James Neal
Last month. And I think we've had two or three of the jobs that I've put us out we've gotten cycling and they're like, oh shit, you guys do this? Help yeah. And a lot of times I even we even like took it a step further. Because I emailed Kendra and Dawn as well and Kendra called me. She was like, hey, if you're doing a final like call me beforehand and I'll check to see if they have money left on the books their contract because a lot of times we'll only do so much work for them and we'll have to actually do like a chargeback and we have to send them money at the end of the project because they haven't used it all.

Chi Ejimofor
So if they That's Kendra, you said Kendra? Kendra, yeah.

James Neal
So if they've got money in the bank already from us and I reach out to them and then say hey why you know why don't you let us do the your cycling you've got some money we'll budget they're like oh just schedule it you know and it's like and it's now it's a set
Chi Ejimofor
And that's like at the yeah, I I rem 'cause Daniel said that er said earlier that yeah, Daniel said earlier that he uh Yeah, he'll find out about yeah, your final inspections and then he'll reach out. But then so I then it so in the last month and then I know he's crazy busy so he may not even be aware but Yeah, I mean I C CM um So he's been on those, but so he's he so he knows. Um so you'll say it now probably it's up to him or salesperson To follow up and like make sure and like see if they can get that money spent.

James Neal
I try to I try to get them to agree to it before it even gets that level.

Chi Ejimofor
You'll speak to the meeting like in person.

James Neal
Yeah. So what I'll do is I'll call Kendra. Uh I can't remember which one. it was it was one of these that I closed out recently I called Kendra and she was like yeah they still have like six grand in their account or in their contract and so I called him didn't tell him how much money he had left this contract that I was like hey um since I'm doing your final I know you guys still you normally when I do a final they'll still be on site for maybe another month so sometimes it's not like an instantaneous thing But if I get them to commit to that, we can schedule it off and you know what I mean? It's just it's it's just a way of us shouldn't. Give them back lots of money.

Chi Ejimofor
And you only do that of course with with your final guys. Yeah. With your finals. So the other guys aren't doing that of course with their finals.

James Neal
They I they are, I think, because in our last SWIP meeting last month I brought up that I was doing this and it was like Tim was really stoked on it so I ideally they will be pushing that as well I don't know. I'm not a brother's keeper.

Chi Ejimofor
But you just yeah, all you do is you do the thing and you do the best you can do and then you and you put it out to other people and then if they choose to came up with the idea and like it
James Neal
Worked. The first time I tried it, it I was like stubbed. Fuck yeah, let's get scheduled. I'm like, oh shit, okay, cool
Chi Ejimofor
And you don't but uh so you and then okay, so you don't do you interact with the salespeople that much? Not really?

James Neal
A little bit.

Chi Ejimofor
Decent decent bit. Not not a ton. Usually a lot of things. What's the context of that?

James Neal
A lot of times what happens is is they they're they're traveling sites pretty frequently. So they'll come up to a site and say something has happened because I only go to my sites every two weeks. And m the majority of my sites. Some of them it's only once a month.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Neal
So if I go one day, say I went today on the twenty-third But on the 30th they have an issue that they need taken care of and our salesperson happens to walk in on the third 31st and I'm still not going to be there for another week, they'll be like, hey, I need blah blah blah blah blah. So they're like a almost like a secondary layer to Customer service and just ensuring that you know it it's a good plan, you know, it really is. And I think it's it's been beneficial. Um the only like maybe downside I would see to it is that uh It's almost like it's almost too many people involved. Whereas like that's great, but like I like to know. Obviously I want to know what's going on on my site.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, Dan Dan mentioned that as well. He's like you kind of prefer that people would call him directly with problems or something. Something then like It's going to somebody else then he's like it's probably it might be losing a tiny bit of context and you gotta go and find out what's going on.

James Neal
email because there are times when I'll see one of my sites pop up and it's like they need to relocate their fence 600 feet they need 300 feet of compost sock and I'm like I didn't know that. I didn't know that though. But there are also times when because I read that and I know that, that I can go there on my next visit and I can check that stuff and I can look at it and it make to the to the GC it makes it look like we're we're on it you know what I mean rather than like here's your $200 report see you later bye You know, I'm like, oh yeah, you know, I was looking on a schedule. We got a rock entrance coming. I know yours compact. I'm not gonna write it up on my report. I'm just gonna note it that you've got it scheduled And then when the Department of Environmental Quality comes through and they're looking at my reports and they go, Oh yeah, so you wrote 'em up for their entrance on this date and then the next inspection you came back and they have it scheduled and ball you know what I mean? It it's it's a paper trip. It just looks better. There's Starbucks there. Patrice or something.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, what's up?

James Neal
You got jerky, you got shiny, you got Starbucks.

Chi Ejimofor
She's finding all the types of goodies in there. Uh okay I'll probably yeah we'll have to do a I don't know we'll have to pick a day next week I'll just What time do you start? Or are you go directly from the home And you're and you live in the west.

James Neal
West side, I guess. But if you want to cruise with me, we can meet here. I can take up here and then because all my sites are around here usually. Yeah I was like probably yeah because I was like I probably have I took uh I took those rings A and M for the air but long so yeah so I put up with my talking which I do a lot of well yeah don't I don't what's that talk a lot what That's a top a lot. Yeah. Yeah?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's it.

James Neal
I know by the time Rick's got out of the truck, he's all I got a headache. I'm like, sorry dude.

Chi Ejimofor
That's interesting. Uh a lot of touch points. Yeah. And I mean it's the superintendent on all the stuff like I mean with regards to like all of the stuff that we provide it's the superintendent
James Neal
intended mostly that so they're they'd be superintendent or like their assistants which we usually call project man uh project managers yeah some project managers are under under the superintendent yes sir So sometimes um you go to PM reach out for certain requests because the superintendent's too busy. Um that's why we have been pushing with our salespeople to try to get entire jobs like yeah we can do your SWIFT We can also do your roll-offs, we can also do your portage-ons, we can also do this, and then pitch it as why are you gonna call eight different people to get your ship
Chi Ejimofor
service things can have one person that you call for one company you know what I mean yeah yeah one one yeah one because I was gonna say in their package if they order five things it sounds like they should Well if they have it sounds like they have uh four four numbers to pitch out depending on I mean you guys are operating on a schedule, but it's like well PJs is on all this stuff is on a schedule, but they
James Neal
We've gotten to the point that's where the salesperson is pivotal because they've related created this relationship with the GCs or the superintendent. They've convinced the superintendent to use us for multiple different divisions. And then they usually tell them if you have anything that you need, you call me. And then the sales facilitate hey I need a sweeper at this site hey I need blah blah blah here hey these guys port a podcast need to be you know so it's And that's just one little aspect of it.

Chi Ejimofor
Ultimately likely, I mean ultimately, well It's it's it's probably hard to be. I don't know how you how hands-on yeah they gotta go everywhere all the time.

James Neal
I I'm with you on if there's just one phone call, hey I gotta do you know this hey and is this like a request line or something like that. Which we kind of do have which yeah yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

James Neal
But it was also idea on our website. If you look at our website, it's like we've got all of our divisions, and it's just like a little box, like a little quick box. It's like get certain sketch. I mean loading kind of dive, yeah. You get like one a day. Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Two a day.

James Neal
We're just random Random people that are like, maybe it's a GC or a client that we already have. You know, or it's it's other people that aren't our clients too. So that was a That was a great idea for him for him. Without the way the customer Go to desert services. com or whatever. net and uh request service They put in their site name, their contact name, a little blur about needed. They send it off and it goes to the right place.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah, it sounds like uh yeah they'll always well, always is a word, but always be like basically we'll have you know it sounds like a lot of people yeah, there's like three three sources of there's like external sources that uh completely external wait there's three sources of uh projects slash One is from salespeople, one is from direct to uh the directors And then there's also, I guess, uh touch points with with you guys.

James Neal
There are times when I go to a site of and super flight. What the fuck man, I need 600 feet of uh sock on this side, man, I need it yesterday, blah blah blah. I usually call Jason Chase the second. Because a lot of times like that's the downfall to my team. I write somebody up. Literally. By mark your site deficient. All corrective actions need to be completed within seven days from this date and the section and noted in the corrective action law.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so if you like write them up, I mean, are you communicating I mean uh is there like c communication or something back to these guys at all?

James Neal
Or they just so it's up to unless it's like unless It's up to that.

Chi Ejimofor
It's up to the superintendent to kind of to so the superintendent basically sees it, maybe you communicate it with them. They see it, you communicate it, they have to then call us to be like, Hey guys, can you fix?

James Neal
this I can't do it that's like the fox and the hen house kind of stuff okay I I can't walk around and kick over your soap fence and be like oh you need some silk fans for a charge you know what I mean it's up to them I'm informing them and letting them know, hey, this is what I see as a professional. This is what I see that you need. But it's up for them to you to pick up phone or email. We need email confirmation.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so we can't uh we can't you can't like have it like the inspection report ding and and they they'll like oh hey I s I heard you had this and call back.

James Neal
digital format that we're going to.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Neal
Will we send our reports or if we have any deficiencies, Jason's receiving Okay. So in the future they will get it.

Chi Ejimofor
And Jason so y maybe you're not a uh but Jason is allowed he sees it, he's allowed to kind of contact them and say I can I can do
James Neal
it as well. You know, I can call somebody and say, hey dude, you need to get that fixed.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, you you can tell them to get it fixed and you can tell our guys, hey you might want to expect a call or you can or you or you can proactively call but obviously you can't specific it.

James Neal
75% of the time I say hey you needed this fixed. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you think uh I mean if if they had somebody from uh uh our side calling like hey we heard about this can we can we go come fix it would you think they they would do it or do you think it's this is because I rem somebody said that this is like a small piece of their thing and usually obviously it's It's like a checkbox at the beginning of the project. They don't care as much. But yeah, I wonder if somebody's following up. Um, like I mean you literally have to follow up, like you go and do another inspection. But if there's
James Neal
So how much happens when two insult.

Chi Ejimofor
So it would be technically so the delivery manager or and or uh well yeah which I guess Jason Jason does does too much of the But Jason slash sales could know about the defici uh about the the report ding. And could follow up if they had the time and see if something could happen and then you know, I don't know.

James Neal
As long as they get confirmation through email Gotta be cleaned up.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh oh you mean like to to do more work. Yeah yeah.

James Neal
The deep condition, you don't hear them on phone calls. Alright, I mean an email. I need an email.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Of course yeah.

James Neal
It's a construction industry now.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah yeah.

James Neal
So you'll get yeah J J Jim Bob told me you needed six hundred feet Who show up in US all and they don't want to pay for it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Alright, so you so those guys could re you know, I guess that would be the sales.

James Neal
They would that's it's a real company I wonder you'd have a blacklist of general contract Literally everybody's at the desk. You received a phone call from this person, you do not help them.

Chi Ejimofor
Because they didn't pay you.

James Neal
Because they didn't pay.

Chi Ejimofor
After confirming probably.

James Neal
After yep. So we've we may have not had it in written documentation, but we were trying to take care of the customer of us. So we go out there and we
Chi Ejimofor
Spend the You take care of your guy, yeah, you're like it's the homie you you hook 'em up, you're like, hey, I got you, I'll save your ass.

James Neal
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But then like when the time comes.

James Neal
And then you try to follow up with the GC or whatever and they're like, I don't know why they don't want to pay. Um do you have anything in writing?

Chi Ejimofor
Like, alright, I got you.

James Neal
Alright, yeah, you're getting on the on the on the big board.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Which yeah.

James Neal
Which has to happen. I hear Don all the time fighting with people to get paid.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh, I guess and I guess those other guys don't really uh the hour the hourly guys don't uh really uh speak with the them much. They shouldn't well they shouldn't be, I guess. There's a problem if they are directly interacting with the
James Neal
With the uh G C that's pretty called some of them. I don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
Is there I mean I guess they touch base uh they touch base when they get on site, but then like they usually just should be working. It's not like they're out there having conversations.

James Neal
Yeah. I mean uh our leads should be always contacting the super when they enter the site so that they know what they're doing and where they're doing it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, okay, I got I forgot. Yeah, you have the you have the you have four person crews and Yeah.

James Neal
Uh okay, okay.

Chi Ejimofor
I was I'm thinking about all the different services and drivers and stuff. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah. But they do that at the beginning of the project and then they're done and then you just start doing stuff. And then they come if they there's something that needs to be fixed and they get called back, they'll they'll reinstall or whatever, fix something. But in general If the the contract if they're lucky they only see those guys once at the beginning and once at the end.

Speaker 3
Uh or as as planned as planned.

James Neal
for the time that day. The Temp Fence guys they usually see pretty regularly because they put up their like privacy screening and we get a lot of wind out here. Privacy screen or takes it, tears it off, and then want it back up. So we have to go out and install a privacy screen. Which we get paid for. you know but I mean like I like this in a I feel like one of the biggest issues is the the quickness that we can react to our customers. Which it it's a double-edged sword.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

James Neal
You don't want to hire so many creators. That they're all sitting around the bundle. Yeah, that's what I was talking to him earlier.

Chi Ejimofor
'Cause he's like I know he has to ha use the general labor thing a lot for water, truck, and for cleaning, but then at the same time you're like But do you like do you have enough to you know and and you saying it's coming up on like slow season for a couple months? Allegedly it's gonna be slow for maybe it's December uh January is a little bit slow, so you don't wanna Pick up like you know, you don't pick up four, five, eight new guys and then have to it's a they and then they leave in two months anyway.

James Neal
But I also don't want to go to a site and write them up for deficiencies and have them email a request that day and after
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah.

James Neal
Because then it's literally documentation of us not going to pass. Which It's like, and I don't wanna when I sign my name on this, like if the powers that be were like Either relying on this or I could lose my certifications.

Chi Ejimofor
And do you see uh well I guess yeah um Temp Fence is uh wait wait wait okay Tempfence is on the same thing as Swip as schedule it's on that that thing that he's got over there So okay, so everything gets scheduled. Just matter of when and sometimes things kind of fall through, but it's like generally everything gets scheduled.

James Neal
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Um in your I mean as a as a as a person watching from the outside seems like you you're you're watching a little closer.

James Neal
And a lot of that probably has to do with the rain is that we've had to push a lot of dops. So they want their install on 10 But rain's a shitload and then we've got 200 customers calling us because we need to go out the fixed fence and we need to do this and do that. Until that install is supposed to have on 1015 might have an on 1020. You know what I mean? You know, so there are there are big times. But that's the construction of the street
Chi Ejimofor
It's not just like inefficiency. Yeah, stuff happens, stuff gets pushed.

James Neal
But from a customer service standpoint Every customer needs to feel like they're number one.

Chi Ejimofor
Of course. Yeah.

James Neal
But yeah, that's that's kind of it in a nutshell.

Chi Ejimofor
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. That's interesting. Okay. Do I have access to this SharePoint? Is it master?

James Neal
Uh
Chi Ejimofor
Uh you should I mean they uh Yeah everything might have like a pat you know, yeah might need access to something.

James Neal
Yeah, you might need to to get access to it, but I'm sure they'll let you in
