I will have to get a what city is this in? And you're looking for 16 feet of fence? Okay, and I probably won't be able to get this until Tuesday for you. I'm booked up already on Monday. Um Jared for 16 feet of fence, how much is that for install and everything? What's that? For 16 feet of fence, install and rental monthly? 16 16 feet? Yeah, 16 feet. It'd be two panels basically.

So $285 to install and then a hundred hundred dollars a month. Yeah Yeah, I won't be able to get there till Tuesday. I'm fucked up. All my guys are left for the day. They've been working since three this morning, so Okay, sounds good? Hey no hey no problem. Thanks for the hug about the fight. Two panels. Yeah. Just come to the yard and grab them.

Chi Ejimofor
Does that guy want to continue?

Jayson Roti
No.

Chi Ejimofor
Um no too much for him. Yeah?

Jayson Roti
Too much and he needs it today. Yeah. And those guys have been going and they've had no dragers last day was today. and then uh so there's no shy he's getting it today. No and I got stuff already on the books for tomorrow that has to be done because it wasn't done today. Yeah. So when stuff gets pushed and stuff whatever and something like And then um Joel can't work tomorrow because there's stuff going on, so at least It's just the one crew. Otherwise usually it's like a sometimes it's a two-crue deal. So here's I'm gonna go into crow. Have you seen crow at all yet? Seen it, but uh so I'm gonna go into crow, so sunlin asphalt, they're done with this toilet. Uh I kinda as as I'm going through, is this okay? Yeah. Okay. Because I gotta keep hammering away and I'll go on to other planes too with uh Hey hey, so sun lens like two two two three zero so this toilet here okay Karen's already got it lined up for pickup so that That one's good. So she probably did something up here. Okay, we'll take care of this. So we're good on that one. But I we always double check each other's stuff just to you know, f verify. So that'll probably be Steven since it won't be Karen and I, so it'll probably be like Hervey and Steven doing that. Her uh Herbie's gonna be doing helping out every once in a while. He's a driver right now, Hervey
Chi Ejimofor
Inspector?

Jayson Roti
No, Hervey.

Chi Ejimofor
Is that different than Inspector? I'm sorry, not Hervey. Um Albert. Albert.

Jayson Roti
You're Albert. Yeah, no Herbie. Hervey's nothing to do with stuff. Um schedule for Friday and is there five four five this week yeah no but I am like I said they'll be taking this over so this one was taken care of unit as we talked about that this morning Oh nice, dude, that's right. Well uh I mean it's season's still February So you wanna go. I mean I'm trying to go as much as I can and I just kind of like dig how much we can for the people. So Okay. Yeah, so now this one is probably renting a water remote. Jared, you you're taking care of the one for Ed Smith. She's pricing for a water ramp and everything. I got an extra shot. Uh where? Inquiring about renting a water ramp. Uh E. D. Smith. Uh let me see all this showing machines pricing here. So Rona Rona feel.

Speaker 9
164 687

Jared Aiken
37 feet from the hydrant across the street.

Jayson Roti
Hey everyone, that's Jason, does the services, how are you? Um, you're looking for a water ramp? Do you need pricing on that or you just want us to hook it up? Oh, okay. Sol's good. Hey, no problem. Thanks. Uh-huh. You bet. Thanks for now. Goodbye. Son one? No, the GC is taking care of it. Okay. Cool. And then I guess other stuff I can show you too when we get through these. So then this one uh they called her Herbie called me and said they need a new sticker because ADQ is going through the new general construction permit, so everybody needs a new sticker And then they have to update their books. Um so these books have NOIs, which is called the notice of intent. Yep. So these have all changed. They were expiring in 2025. Now they're expiring in 2000. So all the new books that we're making are good, but like some of the old books that are out there and old SWIP signs that are out there, they're needing new um So we get a new ASCON number and then actually you've seen the swip signs. So the swip sign has to be updated with a new sticker on it. And they're Herb's trying to get all that done soon as possible.

Chi Ejimofor
Is it the same uh vendor for stickers and science? Mm-hmm.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, unless unless you know unless they need a quick character to probably make it, but yeah Yep, same vendor. So then Karen's gonna have to send this new permit number out that we got. She'll send that out to them and then they'll make a new sticker, you will have to get it back over here, and then Kirby's gonna have to go put it on.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so the inspectors will kind of trigger that. But they but these guys have to still pay for it though.

Jayson Roti
Yes, yep, they're gonna pay for it. Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
So you have to get confirmation of that before you do it?

Jayson Roti
Yep, so probe and then he had that email there. You know this is a new number. Probe steel So then I got it um schedule, I believe.

Speaker 9
Right print out here.

Jayson Roti
So this thing twenty-nine fifty-two Yeah, it's on update that so probably around the 29th we'll get the sticker in. Okay, so she's got that order. Our water setup has deployed pretty goodly Rewind that goes for This would be going to Daniel because he takes care of the meters. For hybrids, see the side is looking.

Chi Ejimofor
So if the inspector sends something, there's a there's an issue.

Jayson Roti
This isn't the inspector, it's the customer. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Just in general, if the inspectors send something, there's an issue, uh They will tell the customer, but they also tell you Daniel.

Jayson Roti
Hey uh 99 holdings um the guy said Okay, I'll put it on the schedule then for I don't need to send an email then. Do you have the address and everything? Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Daniel. Logan had already called him. Did you you already knew that? Oh, because you said the inspectors. I figured you Oh no. I'm like, how the hell did you know that?

Chi Ejimofor
I'm like third. That's pretty good But the inspectors uh do communicate with they communicate with you and they communicate with the guys outside to do stuff?

Jayson Roti
They communicate with me, the sales guys do. I get yeah, I'm getting stuff from everybody. Yep, Kendrose, Jared.

Chi Ejimofor
But if there's so if there's an issue inspector-wise, you still you need to then contact the customers it's a good idea.

Jayson Roti
I need them to contact well they're not been James is good at it. Hervey's good at well Hervey's kinda good at it. Logan not so much. But like when they're out there fixing stuff they need to know what like like this is the fence line say this much is you know deficiency how many feet is that and where is it at on the job site you know like pick pictures or something because then we don't have to bother the super. Like he has to so then they have to go in the trailer and say hey do you approve this because just because there's a deficiency we still gotta get an approval from the um the super on site because they don't have to fix it. Of course. So so that needs to once they're there, they need to go in the job trailer or And they usually don't, so this eliminates a lot of bottlenecks. Send the email right then and you're there. Heck hey, you got a deficiency of this many feet? they send it to the super me and then once they get the approval or they can send it to him and me or just to him once they get the approval send it to me Then I'm not getting all the emails and stuff, but once they get the approval then I'm oh I'll put it on schedule now. Does that make sense?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, so they should be they find something, take a picture, document it, and then they walk they should walk over into the thing and Tell them write the email in front of them that CC is you.

Jayson Roti
Right. And then that's it. Say if they're not there, they get they're gonna get a s the swip um report. Because a lot of them they just get emailed to them. Yep. So but if it's a big enough and there's usually deficiencies, they don't always like s send but if it's a big enough deal, if it's a big enough deal they should say some. You know if it's your rock entrance they'll say hey your rock entrance needs to be fixed. on the thing, but they could be following up on it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
But when that super calls and says, hey, I need this fixed, you know, you wrote me up, then the the SWIP inspector should be f taking care of whatever has to be done, how much it has to be done. and then sending it to me.

Chi Ejimofor
So the swim inspector will actually fix it themselves?

Jayson Roti
No. No. Nope. Our swap guys will fix it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
But if he's writing them up and there's like this much feet or of silk fence or whatever it may be. Or the rock entrance is bad or inland needs are protected. If the that super calls back and says, hey, I saw the deficiency list or whatever, the swift inspection, this is bad. Then or the that guy can send me and Logan or James or whoever. Yep, go ahead and fix it. But I need to know how much and where it's at, like if there's a picture You know of it. So that our SWIP inspector should probably be taking pictures of like deficiencies that they're writing them up on. Yeah. And I know that new app that we're using that Mogan's using, you could take pictures of it all and that'd be perfect for all of them to use. Because I mean there was an old company back like five six years ago we were doing the switch um we were fixing the switch deficiencies. Another company was doing the switch inspections. Yep. But then they'd have pictures and I could see oh that had runoff all over the place over the golf course. So now we gotta clean all the shit. Now I know what to do. I could give it to the guys. They know where it's at they know exactly what they're getting into.

Chi Ejimofor
to does that that makes sense right yeah so they should be documenting they should be they should have that and but then where are they where would they put what are they where are they putting that's the question well right now they really they mean right now they're writing it up on a sheet of paper Yeah.

Jayson Roti
But um they could like when they have that deficiency if they're writing them up for that, they could take a measurement, you know. I mean if it's a if there's a fence line, the only fence panel is twelve feet You can get an approximation. It's like, oh, there's like five fence panels. Okay. I know how much that is. Yeah. Or the rock entrance looks bad. Take a picture of it. You know, I mean then they could have it in the file, so if the super calls, they could send it to me. Yeah. Okay. It just makes sense. It makes things a lot easier for bottlenecks and then and then we're not passing the super to go out and 'cause it happens a lot with a supers like well I was just here with Logan or I was just here with Hervey. Hervey has the measurement and Neither one of them do. Because then I'm like, well I need how much, like what do you think it is? How much is it approximately? Then they get pissed at me. Yeah. Like you guys were out here. Yeah, yeah. So this one need to fix the back flow that That is not called in by those I think Then I usually put a phone number so I know who the hell it was. And then I usually myself if it's Daniel's doing it, so this Fixed by the And that way nobody else is gonna touch it Like if it doesn't get done today then there's twenty-four So then now that that's there, now I gotta go into QuickBooks because in case there's an audit or something, at least they know that we did it. So this is stuff that he's supposed to be doing as well. when he sets up all these things. Like so if say one mirror, say if they had a new job and he's bidding it, he should be putting it in here when he's doing it. Like as soon as he gets the contract, it should be in there. And then anything that comes in, like I'm having to create a lot of these new things. And then like if like so ongoing on the reliance, this should be in there already. And then it saves me timed, everybody else time, because it's already gonna be in there. So it's not me and Kendra doing it or whatever. So it starts with him up front So reliance. This is 99 holdings. You're familiar with the quick books, so then you just go up here, throw the E email in there so this is all approvals that they've asked for. Or if it's a contract, whatever, so
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so base so after it's done after like so after like the swip is done or whatever, you'll just it's it's now it's it's it's goes completed, but then if something else comes up you'll Just make a new entry, ra add it back to the biggest.

Jayson Roti
Right, so if he calls up I'm like, I need sock. So this is where I need the approval from the supers or the salespeople. So I get this and I'm like, oh okay, maybe we need to fix it. So at least if they come and get audited it says come fix it. So they asked for it. So if we want to bill them and everything.

Speaker 9
So Reliance. Reliance.

Jayson Roti
Let's see if Phoenix will take care of this on Monday day now as well. Okay, so this is from Karen Claiko. There was a water leak over there. Daniel, would you take a look at it? I'm still gonna put this in here. I don't know if Karen did or not. Hey buddy. Um And Karen should be doing this as well. Whoever's touching it and it has to be done, they should be doing I mean Daniel and those guys don't, but
Chi Ejimofor
And Daniel has it Daniel uh can use a computer. He's a chill with it probably.

Jayson Roti
I he we've given him a computer before and I didn't he didn't really use it. Okay. But he should be able to use it, so we pretend that maybe So that's crazy. Wedding Turner says you'll be reviewing the existing meters and 27. Okay. So now this one was put on by Daniel. So Daniel was out there yesterday fixing this. So now I'm gonna pull this down. No, we don't be on the slightest one.

Speaker 9
So that was the out of the out there.

Jayson Roti
So this guy didn't want the meter pulled. We put a new meter on there and but he didn't want the old meter pulled until he knew that this one was gonna get certified so we had to get it certified. So if any of it exists So we have Daniel going out and then we have another company called um oh G What I can't remember what the hell it's called. A guy named uh Brian does it, but he goes out and does certifies save a back. We have a meter coming off the hydrant. Mm-hmm. And then you have a backflip comes off of that because it helps prevent the backflow going into the meter. Yeah. But then you have to have a guy go out and certify the meter. And if it's not certified you can't use it until it's certified. So so now we can go out on Monday and pull this. Pull a new backflow and I don't need to call the terminate this one. Just make sure it's an inspection. Call care. Okay, so that's good to go for the 27th.

Speaker 9
So when you turn on
Jayson Roti
And a lot of these steps I didn't have to do stuff with QuickBooks before. A lot of the stuff is like new because of the like uh Don and the way accounting is being done though. Before it used to be we just got email proof of that were good, they didn't have to go into QuickBooks. Water meter. It's a new SWIP. So is it update? Okay, so this guy, I'm gonna try to help him So this is uh people do the NOI. So people would call and then they have all kinds of crazy questions on how to pull NOI So it's this is my day constantly help just all over the board. Yeah. How's it going, bud? See ya, buddy.

Phone #1
This is Jesse.

Jayson Roti
Hey Jesse, it's Jason, Design Services. How you doing?

Phone #1
I'm good Jason. How are you?

Jayson Roti
Good.

Phone #1
So you're trying to pull NOI or Yeah, so uh we needed an update, I guess, from two
Jayson Roti
Oh yeah, so you have to go up to the AD your my DEQ account and have it updated? Just like you're pulling a new permit for the uh for updating.

Phone #1
Yeah, yeah. I just uh my office is trying to gather the login information for me so I can actually get in because I didn't set up the account.

Jayson Roti
Right, I can give you the I was hoping maybe I could do it over the phone, but Yeah, well not through me because that's all through ADAQ. We're not we don't have anything to do with that So I can give you the ADEQ help desk number because that you're gonna have to go through them to get into your my DEQ account. Do you want the help desk number? See a lot of times I think we do it all. Like this all this is through like everybody just see.

Phone #1
Hey Jason, sorry about that. My reception is terrible.

Jayson Roti
Sure, you're hanging up on me. I'm trying to help.

Phone #1
No, I appreciate you. You said I needed to call A D E Q direct speaker.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, and I can give you the help desk number if you want.

Phone #1
Oh yeah.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, because you have to call them and they can probably tell you who signed into it originally and maybe even reset your login.

Phone #1
Yeah, that's where Okay, go for it.

Jayson Roti
Uh help desk number is 844-827-4768. And it's good you you may have to leave a message and they call you back. I used to have phone numbers for everybody, but uh since COVID people have left and quit and so that's the best thing I could do is give you the help desk number and uh they should be able to help you though.

Phone #1
No, that's awesome. I really appreciate it. Hopefully my office can hunt down the information and I can just do it wrong. It takes two minutes online.

Jayson Roti
Right, right. Yep. Well hopefully that helps you out.

Phone #1
I appreciate it. Thanks, Jason.

Jayson Roti
Have a good weekend. Hey you two, thanks, uh-huh. And you know that um all the calls come in through this thing, the call center, so you gotta say everything's done. Okay, this is just a drawing's got a big deal for Rory. Attaches the NLI from ADAQ so then now I gotta go and get this thing ready to go. So this is where all the stuff I in the SharePoint is shared for So catamount, I needed the NOI so we can make the narrative. Um so I'm gonna have to send these to Karen and Kendra. So it'd be nice if there was like some big database and like some Something that had all this stuff so everything for Katamon whether it's a dust permit or NOI all the information would be nice and was all stored
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so right now it's even it's just it's spread between uh SWIP books, there's all this different things.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, so per project, per project it's like it's all over the place, but like so Jarrett really doesn't need it. I need it for the SWAT book, so I'm gonna slide like so I got um the dust control permit that was sent to me from them so I file it over there so I can find it. And then like I said when Jarrett does these um When he starts the estimate, he has a swip plan, but I don't know where he puts them. He's supposed to be putting him in the SWIP plan folder. But I know it takes longer, but it but it takes longer for me to do it but I gotta if I have to hunt it down it takes it bottom next everything yeah so this is gonna get slid over here hey buddy nobody got hurt no nobody got hurt good so that gets slid over there And then I'm going to print this off. I print two copies. A lot of cumbersome shit, right? Yeah, it's interesting uh flow? Yeah. It's it's all my head.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's the fun part to try to extract.

Jayson Roti
No, I know, I know but this way you're seeing everything. So I gotta shut this off because it's in This is a piece of shit too. So we're still off and it's gonna print all kinds of stuff. So wait till that. I'm gonna I'm gonna leave that up, but I'm gonna send this to Karen so because Ken wrote so Karen needs this to make the signs. So she needs I sent her that so she has all that.

Tim Haitaian
Hey how you doing? Hey your dad said nobody got hurt that's a good thing. Nobody got hurt man
Speaker 9
Sour Jason
Jayson Roti
And Karen was looking for that today so we can make a sign. Okay, hey It's attached to no wife for this part, but we know any questions. Gotta see what he's talking about here. Oh my storage. So these So I'm gonna have to call these guys and ask them for approval if they want the sign made because I'm sure Herbie didn't tell them there's a cost involved. So that would have been nice if he just Herbie just took care of that and told you know. what I mean so then we're not three people not getting involved in it. Yeah. And that's this is what happens. So many people get involved in shit that it could that one person that gets a call could just take care of it all. Yeah. Six on it
Chi Ejimofor
This is all part of the sign updates situation.

Jayson Roti
for the NY. Hello, it's quite a bit. Hey Quentin, Jason does a services, how are you doing?

Phone #2
Hey I'm doing good Jason. How about yourself?

Jayson Roti
Good good. So is this the new NOI that you just updated for that project?

Phone #2
Yeah, they were pretty much emailing us, letting us know that it was gonna expire.

Jayson Roti
Right. So do you need to do a sticker made? So what you're gonna want to do on this is you're gonna want to print that off and then you probably have the general construction permit that was printed that came with that email, you wanna you wanna print that off and then your book. So the new that new permit that you just sent me or sent Herbie, print that off, and that goes in Appendix D, take the old one out and put the new one in, and then print off the new general construction permit for 2025 print that it's like 30 pages. I'd just do front and back so it's not as thick in the binder and then take the 2020 general construction permit out and put that new one in Okay. And then do you I'm assuming you're gonna want a new sticker for your sign. There'll be a cost for that. I think it's like fifty I think it's seventy-five bucks for that. So I just need you to email that. If you just want to email me I can give you my eat well if you send it to Herbie and he can send it over to me. I just need an email approval if you're approving that, so Okay. Okay I can go ahead and do that. And it'll probably take a couple days.

Phone #2
Gotcha. No worries. Um Um I'm gonna have to just I'll send the email just for now so you can get going on it, but I'm gonna have to form it and you know do a change order to you again.

Jayson Roti
Sounds good, man. Hey, hey you too. Thanks. Uh huh. Bye-bye. Bye. So like that could have been handled all up front
Chi Ejimofor
Uh, okay.

Jayson Roti
So this is gonna be Katamov. So I in this book I have all all the shit that I'm I've I've gathered. So what's her name? Um so Eva can make uh a narrative. So when this all comes over, I've had to gather all this information, so I have this the dust permit. Again, like so we can make I need a sweat map, but I since I don't have it, I have it so now I have a dust permit, so I have this. I can make the sweat narrative, but I still need the sweat plan and that's like we made it off. Those which were waiting on the sweat plan, which are journey's easy get those done um but at least you can get started on it so this will is this helping you at all yeah At least I can keep working.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so this is a book that okay, this is a book that that will be going out for somebody.

Jayson Roti
Yep, that'll be going out and they need it as soon as possible. So once Rock Okay, so I gotta put a note on here. Ready to make Narrative Use Dust Permit for Location And so like I said sometimes if a swip plan was needed that I understand but since it's not this damn thing should be in the swipment that should be sitting right here So then I gotta go and I gotta wait for it. Normally like when I was gathering all this stuff, I'd have it all ready to go, but now we gotta wait and then you gotta keep asking questions So in here is where all the plans are at. So I unless I put it in recently, so I should be able to type in flats. And it should populate it and see if it's so I know when I did this before it wasn't in here And this thing sucks because it's I don't know any other way you put it in there, but it should scroll down, but it doesn't seem to do it.

Chi Ejimofor
Unless you have a better idea.

Jayson Roti
Yeah So there's FL so it should be so flat should be in there. So okay, I'll try ballpark just in case it was something different. Or just do ball Because sometimes it comes in as a different name. So there's nothing in that ball. So this since he did the estimate, it has to be in here somewhere, but I think he's putting it in So Mickey's shoving into Monday, but nobody we don't use the Monday, so Monday has to go into here because this is how kindra and all of us find shit right now now but once whoever you we are gonna integrate later on when you're gonna devise should be using this now until the other thing comes up you know what I mean yeah keep using the current system And that's how it's supposed to be done or has should be done. Yeah. So then we're gonna I'm gonna run this up to Eva real quick. Yeah. So this all I do is I give this to her and then she'll start making it. And then actually no what I gotta put here. So I've showed you remember I showed you that task thing the other day? So I'm gonna put this book away And you make these both.

Chi Ejimofor
You and and Ava.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, well, these together as the as the She'll she'll plug it all the stuff and then she types it all up and puts the stuff on here, but then I still have to go back and make sure she's she didn it correctly and made sure like the two thousand and I'll c I'll go through one of those and show you what I look at. Yeah. Because so like that but still needs a switch plan, but if um let's see
Chi Ejimofor
On this one you'll print some stuff and just have it and she used to put in the tabs and do all the right and I'll go back and make sure so this one needs a sweat plan so that makes sense that jersey
Jayson Roti
should have ordered a sweep plan so I know we're gonna be waiting for it but say if that wasn't there and it just has swept narrative and I can't find the plan should never be looking for the only next time I should look for a swip plan I've got a swip and to be made.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. And that makes sense. So and then now I'm gonna come over here because now I have this So I when I so when I took everything and I put into here and I'll show you that because so like when I put into here that this job is starting and that retype all this stuff so if there's a better way of taking from QuickBooks and me not having to type all this crap in here because it's it's duplicating it. Yeah it's stupid.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
So I've typed all this in here so when I did that I came over here here and I started the job in here so it's a reminder so I know that it's been done so I could keep a track of it. So who is this? This is Catamo. So catamont right here. So this is the day I got voluntarization. I was waiting on the NOI. I sent him an email asking for it. So now I'm coming down here and going 1024 receive the noi as con number and I put it in here because sometimes we have to go back out and look for it. Then I change it from waiting for NOI here to there and I just said received change this to get progress And then now I know well yeah because now this is gonna be in progress. So when it's complete like those books when they're done I complete them and I take them out of that whole thing and they're good to go. So I'm gonna run this up to her real quick. Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
How's it going?

Tim Haitaian
Good man. How are you? Happy Friday. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
We're back. Learn it, learn this, this is the wildest one of all. Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah. For sure.

Chi Ejimofor
He said that you ran it a um a couple weeks ago. Yeah, yeah.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah, when Jason was out for a couple days, I leaned in and helped out. He loved it. I played my best, Jason. I did my best. I told people, I was like, I'm doing my best, Jason impression this week, you know.

Jayson Roti
He had to put he had to get some platform shoes on to Yeah, exactly.

Tim Haitaian
I'd be swimming in those shoes. No doubt. No doubt. Um well I would love to catch up before the end of the day if it works for you.

Chi Ejimofor
Are you heading out at any particular No, I'll probably be I'll I'll be in a little late probably today. Okay Just uh yeah. And the office is open. I mean you can get I guess if if you have a code you can get in on the weekend or just whatever. If I wanted to like Easy place to sometimes the uh the house gets gets uh loud.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah, no for sure man. Depends on the weekend.

Chi Ejimofor
Sunday fun day with those those guys like to Like to go outside, you know.

Jayson Roti
Speaking of giants, these girls are four foot five. So my friends are like you look like you're seven feet tall.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm like only four foot tall. Yeah. Oh I saw the very very beginning of it. Yeah, tiny. Yeah, she's tiny. Crazy.

Tim Haitaian
Exactly.

Chi Ejimofor
I was gonna say I I was talking to the uh that Dawn, the new lady.

Tim Haitaian
She's Don Miller. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. HR Lady.

Chi Ejimofor
She's some fire.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
She seems like she's like uh she's she does this. Yeah. I was like, I'm gonna sit down with her and and like You know, 'cause she yeah, she said she brought in somebody the same thing to bring in all of the Oh really in her previous company she brought in a similar role.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah. Oh that's interesting.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, pick a brain on that. Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
That's awesome.

Jayson Roti
Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
That's awesome. Well let's plan on um if it's okay with you, let's plan on like um we're gonna catch up with Steven at four and maybe around four thirty as soon as we Is he and I rap like before the end of the day. Yeah, that works for you. That works for you. Awesome. That sounds great.

Jayson Roti
I'm giving him some fun things just doing the work I do so he can see a little bit of everything. Yeah. I mean, you know and going through things like the narrative, like where the narratives go 'cause I know on that that list I was I didn't see narratives on there, like handing those off and all the process. I'm showing him all the process of that right now. Oh, okay, good. Like where that's at, where it goes from there, and like just the stuff that's coming in as phone calls, or just going through everything.

Tim Haitaian
So um have you had a chance to through the whole thing?

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Okay.

Tim Haitaian
Um well I would love to hear um feedback and comments on and when when there's time for that too.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. No problem.

Tim Haitaian
Because I know it's I know it's not complete.

Jayson Roti
Right it is. I know there's some updates that have to be and that's a work in progress like yeah.

Tim Haitaian
No, um, you know, I think the the big thing, we have to share this with other people, the big thing for month one is just document the way the things work today.

Jayson Roti
Yep
Tim Haitaian
you know that's that's really let's just under get a roadmap uh a lay of the land of exactly how things work today and consolidate that in this easy to understand and follow map and then If we're all on the same page as soon as that's ready, then we can start to think about how we start to adjust things with the first two things that I know we can we can take off are the sign making and um and shifting those to Eva and just really designing the process because those are in narratives maybe in a similar way, but you know they kind of can bolt down to whatever the main workflow that we design for everything. The sign making, the dust signs can just bolt right onto that. So they're kind of discrete independent workflows that I think doing those now doesn't impact. the the complete kind of onboarding workflow and we'll we'll we can leverage whatever we do for those into the the complete command.

Jayson Roti
That's why it's actually in that workflow like showing like I have the NOIs and the dust permits like I could for one project it'd be nice just to have those all centralized so everybody can see it or whatever. And like I say in the SWIP plan. So like if he's doing the if he's doing it all of them should be in the um SWIP plan folder, not in the Monday SB. needs to be there and like everybody can see it. Jury can see him, everything. So yeah. But like the you know you kind of want to say Like one spot would be nice for that one project. Kind of like where I I was showing you where I was doing all the narratives and I bring everything into there because I have estimates dust permit. So it has everything for that freaking project. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So you guys have it just all in one place for QuickBooks. It ends up in QuickBooks all in one place, but then yeah, that's where the the delivery it seems. Right, it's kind of like that.

Jayson Roti
And I'm just showing them like all the stuff like making sure we got approvals and that goes into QuickBooks. in case we get audited and then you know like you know it's explaining like uh like um Logan or James whoever not just one of them like
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, similar to that similar to that job. It's Friday, man. Like taking pictures of what needs to be done when we're doing this web inspection.

Jayson Roti
So like pictures are a thousand words, kind of like what we did at Gardens, where if we would have had a picture of that 700 feet where it's at, and like you go there and then like this one person that's done, that's over with, we just hand it over to me or whoever it is. Yeah. And then away it goes. Kinda like uh the um those um swoop stickers. If Kirby would have just said, Hey, send an email versus three people calling him it's like the sticker all he needs is a sticker. Sure. So it's like now three people are It should just be one, just send an email and we're done.

Tim Haitaian
Right, right. That makes sense. So well good. I'm I'm glad he's getting uh uh you know birds I view all this kind of stuff and dating.

Chi Ejimofor
So awesome.

Tim Haitaian
Well that sounds great. So yeah, let's catch up um four thirty. And were you able to submit that ticket to CMIT for the uh windows and all that?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, they got they they were quick on the uh the drive. I mean I just got a notification I just requested a thing for the drive uh but they're slower on the on on the other stuff.

Tim Haitaian
Okay. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Alright, we'll get they're they're they're on it though.

Jayson Roti
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I call it yeah. I'm staying on it. Get it done.

Tim Haitaian
Thanks, man.

Chi Ejimofor
I'll let you guys get back to it. Alright, cool. Okay.

Jayson Roti
Oh just having to like do multiple things on this. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
This is a great remote for mine. That's his job to keep the power on.

Jared Aiken
Hey Todd, this Jared over at Desert Services. Just give me a call back. I got your message about the project at uh South 6A. If you could, you need to call back. This is myself, 989-330-785.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, I saw that guy had that dust permit. And so I sent him that's what I do, right? I hunt the dust permit site and He says, well how about the the sign is and then I've never going out there today. Yeah, I think I was sitting here in the hallway after it I thought, oh I forgot about that. But anyway.

Jayson Roti
Oh that's good. Yeah. It was on schedule for today, so it was actually on schedule yesterday too. Okay. But cool, it's good to find it. Some blank gold I want to be aware of some monster.

Jared Aiken
This is uh Jared over at Desert Services, trying to reach Tammy. Tammy, she's an estimated. Tammy E. Uh she just called and uh I guess was asked about it.

Jayson Roti
Hey, is this Elliot the thing that Uh NY sticker you need is this for Elliott and Ellsworth, the 351 South Ellsworth Road. Okay. Yeah it does. I just didn't know Elliot and Ellsworth are the same thing and you never knew No, I just want to make sure. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. Thanks. Uh-huh. I mean this general but as you saw this audio.

Jared Aiken
Good. Um I saw the Uh yeah. Kinda. I mean there there's gonna be there's gonna be some terrible But for the most part our icing is pretty set. So I'll send you one order on that roll off. Yeah, it's also
Joel Puzel
Uh we're on that one. Yeah. Yeah, because that's they're amazing, right?

Jared Aiken
Oh oh the TI, yeah. Uh sorry, they're doing the East Market Yeah. Uh it's right on the house Yeah, live and both close to each other, right? Oh okay. Yeah. I think they're like right next door. Yeah, it's it's like probably Five hundred feet of it. Very close. Love to get some defense on that. be able to see it over there. Yep, that's right. Yeah. Uh but cool. I'll you want me to just set it to the estimating Yeah. Make sense? Oh. All righty. Appreciate it. Do you have an address or a contact?

Jayson Roti
Hey, what site is this uh um number for my storage? Is that the one in Prescott 2971? Are you talking to me? Okay, so that's the last kind of number for one person.

Lacie Slevin
For MT builders be high every high crossing. Do you have any information on where that's at? I think that plans.

Jayson Roti
Okay. Yep. And then it's but when they send it, have them send because I've had to call them back because we have to have for QuickBooks, have them say have 'em approve the switch that Because there's a cost to it. So I've called you. Okay. Yeah but if you have it, just re m try to remind him I tried to call Quentin and the other guys, so they were all cool with it, but they just had to send another email. Also high Evergreen at Lee High Crossing, but we need to be open. Okay.

Jared Aiken
So when I go to walk in like a big thing.

Jayson Roti
That happens. Yeah, these don't know. So cool.

Jared Aiken
But we won that one. Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Right. So there's I've got it I've got it sent over to Karen stuff, so.

Jared Aiken
Okay, thanks. Okay, bye-bye. Yeah, by the way, I don't know why I have this. You guys should have uh uh quite as something like Go through all the dust permits. So these dust permits have the uh um address on it. Well, sounds weird. Yeah. So we'll have two You can have a lot of people.

Jayson Roti
Jared's favorite song.

Rick Haitaian
So kind of I like Boy George on a screen. I don't know if he is or not. If he is, whatever. You were in the day. Big hat.

Jayson Roti
With the big hat. Oh yeah. Yep. I did the moon walk with the Michael. Oh yeah. All that good stuff. What's a quick question? Um
Rick Haitaian
We were able to get that on what was it, the plan underway for uh Meh. Uh no, wasn't Mehot, was it? No, um Duncan, Duncan residents or whatever it's called. Send it to them. Uh let's see if they've returned to the Okay. I mean we told them today or Monday, sounds good the I just want to go.

Jayson Roti
There's nothing that's doing that one, it's just the own block for it.

Chi Ejimofor
So you just file that away, you don't have to do anything with it.

Jayson Roti
Not that one. No, that's just them telling me about some shit that they're doing out. So I don't even need that email
Chi Ejimofor
It's like the stuff they're doing out there for they just give you a notification about the project, but yeah, it's something to do with like uh risers and stuff.

Jayson Roti
We have nothing. Yeah, that's not what we do. Um Okay, so Kieran is taking care of this one, RSM, so I don't have to deal with it. I'll just see if there's anything in here though. RSM Yeah, so she's got that one taken care of, Roger RSM. And I don't think we've ever done anything with it, but she's emailed him back asking for information. But I'm still gonna put it in here Case it's similar. Sticker maids, that's already been in progress.

Chi Ejimofor
Alright.

Jayson Roti
A lot of redundancy in this shit.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay, I think I see all the huh? Yeah I got access. I see all the files, so I'm not gonna touch anything. What do you do? Huh?

Jayson Roti
Are you gonna see all the files now?

Chi Ejimofor
I think so, yeah. Yeah, documents and insight library. Yep, yep, yep, yep.

Jayson Roti
So though this one came in the other day, but these needs to get to it so they're still waiting on it. So I'll send up Try this file this one. So now you're on the screen for interesting question that called that line. I'll show you this one what I do with this. So MT homestead homestead leehigh. And yeah, the high we still need the plan for that one.

Jared Aiken
I can't even get the drawing I've been back and forth with them all day.

Jayson Roti
Okay. So this one I look at that.

Jared Aiken
Unless you got any of the drawings out I don't know where they could be.

Jayson Roti
Well they were in the they were in the set. They were in like the email for like the contract stuff. It's kinda like that. That's all I have. I can't do it.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, they can't do a switch run. Well it's all on Procore, but they have haven't given me access to ProCore.

Jayson Roti
It was in it was attached to like it had the estimate and this in there. Yeah. And the email So this one here I make sure it's all lined up so I make sure this number is the same one one so sometimes she doesn't most times it's good but I just verify it is and like before it was just me I just I would didn't have to go back and review it but she's doing it so the dates right this date here 1010 2025 820 okay so the address which is soft east corner makes sure that's all good. Their billing address their address was there. And then this is kind of boilerplate here all the way to Here again homestead Lehigh which is right here so it has this has to be whatever's on this has to be the same in this book so like say sometimes empty builders they'd have uh another contractor do it whatever's on this it has to say whatever that is so this does say empty builders but say if it said G-con whatever because GCon was doing it, then it had to have G-Con even though MT Builders was doing it. Whoever is on this has to be in here. So that's good. And then so the lads lungs, I look here and make sure those are they're all right so because sometimes inspectors will look at them 10. 57 acres so back here this number um And then Todd Todd Berta. Make sure that that's right. These addresses are correct here. Southwest corner, Todd Burda, Todd Burda. 10. 57 acres and then I go here to make sure that she did the right soils map because she pulled a soils map back here Make sure it's there. Make sure that kind of lines up with that picture that she had up there because you gotta like draw a little map. So This has to kind of line up because that's how we were able to make the narrative. So this is that porch parcel. So when you go in here to do this, you have to like draw the diagram of where the soils are So she did a good job there. And then so those are the soils. That's good that is uh did i no so well i'm gonna have to have her go correct this because this should have been shifted down there should be on a whole new page this should be 1. 1 so then this like the page there should be a page break in here.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Why is that?

Jayson Roti
Because it's going on to the next section here. Because all these are so like there's section three, section four, section five. So that shouldn't have a that that should be pushed down. I see, okay, so sections should be on their own pages.

Chi Ejimofor
So this will be backwards shifting. That would be an interesting. Okay.

Jayson Roti
What shifts uh okay all she has to do is go ahead, you know, a key here and push it down. Yeah. And then it will go over and then she has to print these new pages out. A lot of times I'll like these these um what we're using for making these I'll use some of the same ones I've used for MT builders but sometimes it says silk fence she's gotta make sure she pulls silt fence out of here because sometimes they'll have to be silk fence so that has to be corrected which she did good but sometimes there'll be silk fence in there so I have to make take that out of there.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
Because sometimes you have to do something.

Chi Ejimofor
Is it like highlighted some okay in the in in the does she have is it a template or something like that?

Jayson Roti
There's a template yeah and I'll show you. A lot of times I pull all that stuff and I find them for her and sometimes I use like an old one and I read rename it but it has a totally different name than MT builders. Yes I pull them and then all that's good. That's good. So that would be sometimes cell fence would be there And then on this, a lot of them had 2020. We gotta make sure that's always changed to 2025 now because of the new permit That's good. So I gotta make sure these are the maps. Yep, that's the map, the correct map that goes in that area. And then that's just a location map for it. C is gonna be the new permit I can make sure that she's got the 2025 in there. Your NOI goes here, this section, which is good Those are good. So we put new ones in here and just make sure she's got a new page in there that was built within what she made. Sorry because I've just done it so many times. I'm just making sure each one has the right section, each piece. So then this is make sure that Logan's name is in here. Our inspectors are in here. No, we put both of them in just in case. So I need to get James's now added to this whole list Um which we'll start doing that. And then so this is the game when game fish and park is an endangered species. So this is all in here, the dust hermits in here So we're good there. Appendix M, these are all the like I talked about best managed practice managed practices. So this is all the stuff that could be possibly done on that job site. It has to be in here. case the SWIP inspector wants to see like how was it done or what so these are always it's always in a book because it's like a boilerplate like I go get a whole bunch of these made and then basically the only thing I really put in here is this up front section, the site maps, location maps, and then the uh soils report and a dust birthman. RCL and then the new um so like the new plan but this one doesn't have a plan which makes it handy but I'm gonna put this in here while I'm waiting so they have it.

Jared Aiken
Um QR call up and explain what's going on and then give you guys.

Jayson Roti
So now that that's done, I'll go here. uh helps uh do the split plan so this will go up on top but now we gotta take over here and nine So we have to go correct those. Got them all done.

Rick Haitaian
What's it
Jayson Roti
So which one? So M MT Builders Bronco I got Renaissance Uh and these guys come in at the end of the I know I'm switching gears here. But so these guys will come in when they're done and make sure what's done. So and I I haven't been Right no I know. So Bronco Butte, so I've already talked to him earlier, so now we've already pushed that. It was supposed to be for they, but they pushed it because we couldn't do it. And then uh Darren, I have Darren's. They were acting like it wasn't the time they wanted, so that's the empty builders that's something just like that. Where's Bron compute right here? Okay, yeah, bro.

Chi Ejimofor
Did we charge them for just showing up? Or no? We didn't include. Oh okay, it was it was before.

Jayson Roti
No, I did not make it over there. I called them before I left to make sure that we responded to do stuff and they were saying that No, not today. So normally we don't want to do that because then it puts us back on Monday when we have other shit. Logger house was also pushed, so we're doing it on the 20th. 27th but we called them so I've already I'll be printing out new ones. If you're aware of it and we're all good on that if you have any questions. And then Concord, Sun Valley. That has a slip sign installed on the west right side. Sun Valley Those are for the so okay he was going so that one's done so I'm gonna mark it in the green So now it's done. And then you're gonna do a job tomorrow, right? Yeah I have that and there's two sock trailers waiting for those to be installed tomorrow. So that's done. So that one's done.

Jared Aiken
That one is your original NOI.

Jayson Roti
El Mirage, so Ellsworth has to be done in the morning. Oh this is the one that's in the morning? No, we'll do it. as a turn. Renaissance? Renaissance. Peter's done. They're done. Peter sunshine. Took a lot longer than I needed it too. But uh it's done. Peterson And then Marbella ranch is the one or more to the colour. Yep for tomorrow. Thank you. Thanks, but have a good night. Okay, so now I gotta go now switching gears back to this thing. MT builders. I would make the call first. MT builders, so I gotta keep her this back as well. She needs to So this one has to be digitized. MT Builders always wants it all digitized, so she's gonna have to pull this all apart, scan it all in.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean she already made it to print, right?

Jayson Roti
No, she sh well only per portion she made was I'll show
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, she made okay, she made uh some of it to print, but so like the NOI I guess like dust permit. She did she didn't she doesn't have the dust permit.

Jayson Roti
No, so like this whole book needs to be scanned. So there's only It's only portions of it, so before it was put together. Like sometimes it's better like she's had to pull all this apart, but like usually before when I would build one, I would just have all the pages and then I'd just shove them on in here. Uh if that makes sense. Because a lot of it's boilerplate. Yeah. Yeah. It's like all of the books up there in the white, those all have like boilerplate stuff in there that we fill it in. Yep. So now this is gonna all have to be scanned because if you MT builders requires it to be scanned. Not everybody does, just MT. And then they need a safety book and then those have to be delivered. Homestead at Lehigh Crossing. So now I have to go into here, do another line up. And then so for Kendra to build now that the mirror is done, it's close enough to being done. Getting rid of that And then they go here almost with the Switch narrative for all the To finish the
Rick Haitaian
Customer. No.

Jayson Roti
Oh, you guys have it. Yeah. Okay, so then we gotta put this down here. We're still waiting on that. And then this just lets me know that we're almost done with it, but I'm waiting for it to actually be activated right now. So if Kendra's looking at or somebody's calling, I could I know where it is, because she's already she's in the bill for that. And then I gotta go over here, I gotta clear this one out over here, just so I know it's done, empty down there Someone didn't want to do that.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, so if you look at the NOI, uh central, you go down like yeah. So content twenty that's usually controlled. Not always, but it's kind of number one one two thirds and two.

Jayson Roti
So then I go here just to write complete this thing so it's done. So take this out of there. So now that's out of this whole task folder. So then now I gotta go Over here and finish this one out so I can go to the sweep. A lot of moving parts of this thing, right? Yes. Gotta go here, find the MT. builder's book but i'm gonna leave it in here for right now because she's gonna have to read oh she has the folder so i gotta delete this out because this is what i had in there for her To complete this thing. So it was a different thing, but it had a lot of MT builder stuff. So I'll go and find one that was like MT builders. Yeah. But it's all she does is she's gonna everything that's red. never type over. Like all this all this information has to be due. The black stuff can stay the same but the stuff in red all has to be changed.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And this is okay. Um let me see this.

Jayson Roti
And that's just like a boilerplate. thing see how see how this one so I don't know what she did but this in here that section is pushed down yep so now I'm gonna delete this one out of here because It's been updated and then empty builder so this one here I'm moving this over because this is updated when she's completed and I'm sliding this over here. So then once this is done, I could go, I'm not gonna move it now, but I'd go into M Mt builders. Um shit MT and then I would go and I would move to and I'd put it into the complete section. So I'd take that and I'd move it. And I would move it it over to completed because then it pulls it out of the whole thing where the NOIs need to be made.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
That makes sense, right? And then NOIs are after.

Chi Ejimofor
But yeah, and then so they would make it, they would make the NOI based on the other.

Jayson Roti
Yep, and so now the NOI is done, but I still have to wait. So this is I've already alerted him. This book's gonna go
Chi Ejimofor
up top there waiting need need plan so then this one's done and right on here finish oh that's what okay I was gonna I asked her like why is that s uh slashed through like that.

Jayson Roti
Oh yeah just me saying it's done twenty And I'll take this up to her and shore later on. Um so let's um This was kind of crazy, A D C
Jared Aiken
My father saw too.

Jayson Roti
Small this one.

Chi Ejimofor
So this is me typing all this shit in by So these the completed books in there are this are scanned full done things that we want to scan is empty builders
Jayson Roti
Okay. Otherwise all the rest of them, yeah, don't have to scan them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, like all these, I won't have to scan any of them, but see, this one we're still waiting on a sweat plan.

Chi Ejimofor
But this is what I well yeah, so what I mean you so you have she prints out something. What part of it is it like this part it needs to be signed?

Jayson Roti
What part what part needs to be signed? So the wood part needs to be scanned for that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, because you have a digital you have a digital version.

Jayson Roti
Not with all this stuff in it. Not with all this stuff. Not the guts. Only thing we have is this. So this is what she's she's done.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that does not include all the rest.

Jayson Roti
No. Nope. And a lot of times we have not done that because once somebody can get a hold of that, then they don't need us to do anything because they can copy, then this whole book can be copied. So we've tried not to ever give digital copies because you could manipulate the hell out of it and then you get all the information you need.

Chi Ejimofor
And having this is what everybody wants Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Because you could you could tear this stuff apart. And then they don't need us to do this stuff later on. That makes sense. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So the people that get it scan they have they require but scan it on the printer.

Jayson Roti
I don't do digitize. I mean anything.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, so the so what she puts together even okay.

Jayson Roti
Ultimately yes you could take and blend this all together into one big packet.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
But then if you do that then they have I mean they could tear this apart and then they could just do it themselves like MT could do it or Layton could do it themselves if they're smart enough to know how to do that. Yeah So I mean eventually we probably would have to, but like this one we're still waiting for the sweat plan on to be made.

Chi Ejimofor
They could still like like parrot like it's not a good thing.

Jayson Roti
Not if I scan it.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh I see, okay.

Jayson Roti
By the scanning as a PDF, it's the whole thing's a PDF versus putting it all together like Okay, I see.

Chi Ejimofor
So we wouldn't okay, so if we did have like a digital version, let's say
Jayson Roti
Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Like yeah, to scan it, it they would have yeah, it's not like an easy uh yeah, it wouldn't so like this is all scanned as well.

Jayson Roti
So I have a whole book as scan, but it's not like each piece isn't into the Let's see So like when I take stuff like the big boxes of Kinkos This is everything. This is the whole freaking this is a whole scan book right here of the boilerplate. Yep. So if I need like That's all like but not including this.

Chi Ejimofor
If that makes sense. Yeah.

Jayson Roti
So okay, so okay. But then you have you have EPA NOIs too, which I haven't really shown even how to do those. That's a whole di that's a whole different version of a but that's not common I guess. Not very often. I try not to do them and we try to charge more So this is what basically she's done. And then she's also pulled the soils report, which is from a whole different um soils reports go through
Chi Ejimofor
I saw yes, you showed me the two. I was I saw I was up there asking her what she was doing.

Jayson Roti
And then uh also you have the endangered species, which is um um Yeah, um they're both dot goes. Yep. So those if if you want AI to do it, I don't know how you would pull it.

Chi Ejimofor
I well yeah, I because you're gonna I would probably leave that as manual, but I mean you you would have to have like an an
Jayson Roti
Because you would have to like you'd have to like you'd have to say I wouldn't have to how does it know where the fucking section is? I mean you could plot it, but even if the plot is on like uh the parcel land, like if you like a parcela, it's not always including that whole parcel.

Chi Ejimofor
You'd have to have a very smart uh thing.

Jayson Roti
Yes. Yeah. Believe me I'd We've tried a lot of stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
It's not I mean wherever whenever you were trying, there's there's y we can't there's I wouldn't uh there's like these two pieces where I'm like, Yeah, just go in and go in and yourself for those two, but yeah.

Jayson Roti
The other process, possibly, but then but you're changing. So like a lot of this has like these sections are the same, but then this changes here and then the same this the same shit you're putting here You're putting here and here, yep, but they gotta change like these things are different down here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
And then a lot of this is all I mean it's pretty much boilerplate, so
Chi Ejimofor
You know, and then so she has to go she has some she has a template or something she has like extra stuff that she'll print to go along with this this this she's filling out.

Jayson Roti
But all you gotta do is allow them this is replace all yeah or replace you know you you pick what you want to replace it replaces them like I slide you know you slide here replace that with this name this doesn't take that much time just time consuming.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
And then you gotta then you gotta print you know you gotta print the front page off, you gotta slide it in the thing. Where's the f okay.

Chi Ejimofor
That's we have it some we have a template somewhere. I did I I saw that yeah I saw the uh the I saw a folder that said templates or something like that. Um yeah, swip narrative examples and templates. Is she printing off from there probably?

Jayson Roti
Uh front pages and stuff, yeah. Yeah So that goes away there. So let me go into GANA here. So I'm gonna reset this.

Chi Ejimofor
And the other companies ones look the same, right? I mean basically.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, he just changed the names of the template So Ganym Pacific Tech, this came in. I don't know, all the guys said he's he wants this, but just in case he wants more So this came in the contract came into Jared. Kendra and Jared have to go through get it done, but I had the guy send me an email says I want 1200 Said he may need this stuff later on. So I'm just gonna copy this portion here. I'm gonna do need to schedule because right now is all he wants is That. So at least I don't have to retype all this shit. But um need Doing the work. Uh see how can we get through science where to do another So it's stupid to have to retype this when it's somewhere else. I just don't know how to get it in here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Speaker 9
There's a two
Jayson Roti
So we'll be done. It's a rock entrance So they want one. Gotta see if they want grates. No grates were down below, so we're good there. That was good.

Chi Ejimofor
Where did you where did you get this imprint?

Jayson Roti
Um I had to go in and look at the like The guy wanted it, so I went and looked at the job, so I knew it was this job. Yeah. He wanted it eight faster than Yeah, so Michael Michael got an email and I'm like and he's like Like um Michael got an email, he said he needs it as soon as possible, then I go, we don't even have a contract. And then Jared found the contract and then he had to send it to Ken.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
But it hasn't been signed, so I need something saying you want it before the contract's done because he's getting in trouble. So now um So then they want eleven inlets, then you gotta do this, do three, um protect, eleven drop with fabric. For so it's a lot of time consuming just typing this if there was a system that would make it go. Yeah.

Speaker 9
Four curb minutes five
Chi Ejimofor
These are in the okay. So this would be in QuickBooks. So you went and found it in QuickBooks.

Jayson Roti
So like on this one in QuickBooks, it wasn't in here, so it's under Ganem. So I had to come in and then Jared had it and he sent it to Kendra so I had to move it over. So Gannum. So this wasn't in here yesterday. So Pacific Tech so I I had to go in here because I couldn't find it so you gotta go in and you gotta find the estimate and so there was the estimate. So I had to find the estimate, print that off And then I'm like what do you want on this thing? I have no idea what you want. So then that's where I had to go in over here. So all the stuff I got from him for that email saying yet go for it is right here now. So he sent me Please begin to skip to install the walls as soon as possible. So now at least we can go install this.

Jared Aiken
is done. Who did it? Uh I don't know, not us. Can you send it to me? It was in a brook or I put it in data drive and send you link to it.

Jayson Roti
Okay. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
So you should have got an email from like our data drive or whatever Whatever. There you go.

Jayson Roti
But how can I drop that into okay I just downloaded? Download a print. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
It's in the data drive. Okay, so that's fine.

Jayson Roti
So I'm gonna print this. So I'm gonna print this one for this. So now I don't want it to be that Let's see some three pages. And now that that one is done for MT builders, NOI
Jared Aiken
What other ones we got? The Postco channel. These all have.

Jayson Roti
The ones on top need to be done with
Jared Aiken
These two?

Jayson Roti
Yeah.

Jared Aiken
I still don't know where that I've never seen anything about that one. Or this one. This if we take Car of Gilbert and SR Mesa.

Jayson Roti
The share drive thing.

Jared Aiken
So nice of that.

Jayson Roti
Then I gotta pot I gotta run this thing over here. So that one, so now that I have it, I put it in this packet.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. Okay. You put it yeah with the SW.

Jayson Roti
And then you just may have So did they so I don't have anything I need to know how much it cost and where it's at so I could build for it.

Jared Aiken
What you said we have that one studio res No, that one is theirs. No. We did not make that one.

Jayson Roti
No way. No, I know that. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
Lehigh.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well no, Lehi says it needed a plan, so we don't need to make a plan then.

Jared Aiken
Right.

Jayson Roti
So then I gotta so then send Kendra and everybody a message on that one. So now I'm taking that note out of here for MT. That no plan is needed.

Chi Ejimofor
Double check the phone number.

Jared Aiken
Oh look at this. Dum dumb. I guess I'm just being smart today or something. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. No, I sent this to I don't remember getting it.

Jayson Roti
I don't know which video.

Jared Aiken
We've had this one for a minute. I didn't know SR Mesa was studio rec It's now it makes sense.

Jayson Roti
But I did send it to you. There's the plan for SR. Did we do anything with it or did they suddenly make did Ulta make it? Jeez. No. Because if they did then I need to know the price so we can bill them.

Jared Aiken
Yeah. We didn't now make this.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, hello. Uh this is Chief from Desert Services. Uh I have a ticket that uh I wanted to try to get an update on and see if I could get it resolved Um, can I give you the number? It is T Two zero two five one zero two two period zero zero seven two Okay, sounds good, thank you.

Jayson Roti
I don't know. All right, so yeah. So now I gotta do strip sign. Like I said, a lot of it's just time consuming shit. Uh install on posts. So this is for the swift guys when we do go do it, they know the sweat installs on post, but once I do talk to the guy, he may change it to go on um fence. Skill kit
Chi Ejimofor
So there's there's an order depending on it depends on the estimate, but it is like there's an order to do things in general depending on the estimate.

Jayson Roti
Right. Most times we're gonna go on post. So that's when And those those and swiped inspections, so slip inspections. Two and then so right now is about the so I'll put this uh red So then right now what I would do but I know I don't know what they want off of this because he just said he wanted it so otherwise right about now I would send an email to Miguel and I would say um please send me the NOI so I can start making the SWIP narrative and SWIP sign, but I don't know if the guy said here didn't want it, so I'm waiting for the contract to come back saying yes or no and then I would ask them um for the dust permit and then it does say we'll just go in post or signs and then who's the site contact on here So but when as soon as that stuff is like like from uh we know we're gonna get it an email if we could go out and ask all those questions and then think it handed
Chi Ejimofor
to me and I'd already have it all. Is this like a master that's just the estimate.

Jayson Roti
But the contract came so now you gotta match this up this piece with the contract.

Chi Ejimofor
So But the contract didn't come through you said. Um Kendri's gotta sign it yet.

Jayson Roti
So the contract came through that wasn't the same dollar amount. It wasn't. Uh uh. Okay. So now you gotta find out where the discrepancies are are is it the spill kit they don't want is it the rock entrance and then pull that out get this estimate and then once the estimate's good then like An email should go out and saying, get all that information, like the NOI, the dust permit, does it you know, all that stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
And then hand it to me, and then I can make it on on a schedule. But this has to match with the contract.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. That makes sense. Um yeah, what would be good, I guess, yeah, it would be good to 'cause you don't know this is actually what's gonna happen. Yeah. If this has everything on it, it would be good to know like okay, I mean, let's say if if a project has the works.

Jayson Roti
Yep, right.

Chi Ejimofor
Then like go down like what okay, if it has the works Then the first thing you need to do is what a dust or this will pretty much have the works. Okay.

Jayson Roti
But sometimes they're gonna on the contract like, oh we don't need a mob, but no, you do you need the mobs. You need the those back in or they're gonna switch to say I don't want 21 inspections I only want 10 yeah but then that's gotta get changed and that's gonna match the contract so that I know what to
Chi Ejimofor
to give them so the first thing that in general you have to do is match it all up match yep but then a lot of times this guy doesn't have time to do it so he sends me an email saying just
Jayson Roti
my sock in. So now I'm putting the sock in and I'm waiting for exactly what else they need or if they need a sweep narrative and like well then send me the NOI and tell me an email that you want this until I get the contract. And I guess like bits and pieces of shit.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. So here's the contract.

Jayson Roti
See it's one one four. So this is so this would be all matched up. Let's see if can we sign it No, it hasn't been out for six since who sent it. So Jerd sent it, but he sent it yesterday as well. But so it's a different dollar amount than this. So now you gotta find out why is it a different dollar amount after going through and reading through this Like you gotta find out in here. Uh what do they say?

Chi Ejimofor
So at the start they j they could request at the start they could request any of the things just in advance and money they could yeah. But any of the is there like a couple things that they
Jayson Roti
sometimes is like they use and they don't really spell it, they just they say what they want but they don't give a quantity. Yeah. So so that's they w they want the sock, they want the So they want the narrative, but the other guy said he didn't want the narrative. He wants a sock as you're going down. He wants a storm-drain inlet. So is there a rock entrance in here? Yeah concrete roll off so the inlets so it just says inlets but you don't know do they want the storm do they want the curb they want all of them I'm assuming so but we gotta figure that out so concrete roll off dust sign they want on this one it doesn't show They want the fire sign, but the fire so see they want the fire sign, but the fire sign is not extended over either So they're asking for it, but it's not even on here. So they want that. Um they want the dust sign but no the swoop sign's not in there so what is it that they want?

Chi Ejimofor
Oh okay and this is the yeah he sent me I saw this contract earlier. Okay.

Jayson Roti
Yeah so if we come here Then you got 16882 minus say the SWIP sign of 275 It's getting close, so evidently I don't see a swip sign on there, but that's what you gotta you gotta match all this shit up to see what they want.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah
Jayson Roti
And that's where and then and then once that's done then let me know hand it to me and then I'll get it in here but then it doesn't make any sense to be going back and forth like like me, Kendra, everybody. Just like put over jerk or you and and then then hand it off 'cause otherwise it's like twenty emails I don't like you to see.

Chi Ejimofor
Is this estimate in the it should it be in the is it in the QuickBooks Is in QuickBooks only is it in uh at SharePoint anywhere?

Jayson Roti
No, it's only in QuickBooks. Okay. Yep, because all the all the estimates are I don't know if he's doing them in Monday or not, but all of them need to be in QuickBooks because otherwise we can't see them and people call
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
So most of us are looking at QuickBooks for stuff, not Monday or anything else.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I'm trying yeah, I'm trying to get access to this thing But these guys are taking it. So this is where it's at right here.

Jayson Roti
So it's under this section. And it's right here. So now this needs to be brought over. You know, but like this this should have all like when this comes in, like that came in, this should have been populated, but I had to do that and I had to put all this stuff in here which normally he should have had it all done ready to go.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah
Jayson Roti
And again specific returning five days of the contract, you got all the guidelines there So that's Gannum. Um Gannum, Gannum, Gannum. specific tech so that goes there so like say for instance this one when I said all the different things that have to happen for so Guthrie is very specific about what's happening with this this one which I'm not gonna do right now because I don't I got other stuff I gotta put done. So Guthrie, all the stuff that has to happen. So here's kind of a site map. On this one they have a whole bunch of shit which we normally don't even know we haven't normally had to do. But so this would be something whoever gives a contract and make sure what we need. Sight hours, I have to know that because dot times we don't doesn't matter, but I need to know that for this job. Trade parking, I need to know that because you're not supposed to park anymore else but right here so I gotta let my guys know that so all that stuff has to be delivered to me letting me know pre-test plans those are all I don't know if those have to be done beforehand and then Don takes care of a lot of that stuff like uh for badging and stuff so if that has to happen that has to go to Don for badging and get all the guys and find out who's gonna be going there um all PPE so everybody should wear PPE anyways. It's like no eating or drinking. I need to know that because most sites don't say that. But I need to put that in there so my guys see that yep so this is all stuff that I need to know before this happens like that that packet that should be given to me has all that ready to go. Yep. Like in an email saying you can't do this, this, and this. And is it OSHA? Is it? Because right now it's like all over the place.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Jayson Roti
Not trying to overwhelm you.

Chi Ejimofor
No, I'm just I'm just getting all of it, getting all of it in and well I don't know what uh sometimes yeah those sometimes those guys are quick, but I guess certain things only like a supervisor does over there at uh CMIT or whatever.

Jayson Roti
Right. Then this goes aligned through here and when they got it done I'm gonna file this down until I hear from somebody so it goes in that big book.

Jared Aiken
I gotta go get my son.

Jayson Roti
Alright buddy. Have a good one. This goes in this book, but again, I we may not get a contract for like the narrative. This basically goes in here because I know the narratives are gonna be made. But if it's I don't need anything else but fence, I just file it down there But this way. And I don't know if there's a a plan even for this thing. Because I haven't I haven't been able to find it because it's not he doesn't always put him in there. Yeah. I think he puts them in Monday
Chi Ejimofor
Which again that doesn't help any of us or me anyway, yeah you but probably find the estimate in Monday to like kind of look at stuff.

Jayson Roti
But yeah of course like the thing is It should be built the way it's been done. Yeah. So everybody that's doing it and touching it should be able to see it, not just the way it's been we all wanted to be done.

Speaker 9
And then this is trying to go here
Jayson Roti
So now I'm gonna build like I'm I started putting stuff already in here in this thing from earlier today So like Primark. So this is gonna start printing out the work for Monday
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
I'm gonna run this thing up wrong. Yeah, so maybe Yeah, look up.

Chi Ejimofor
stuff on the weekends?

Jayson Roti
Work.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, do you work on the weekends?

Jayson Roti
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But for mom.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, but uh like I had my shit When I have uh my bod or like I used to do like twenty of those on a weekend and they usually took about two hours. Two hours per narrative sometimes Not always, but at least an hour and a half by the time you get it all done and looking for stuff and sometimes you can't find the stuff Like this book's been around so long we don't believe we want it anymore.

Rick Haitaian
Okay, it's closed. I think we can do that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, if I uh just in general just to get like the overall thing let's say like contract is good they they want everything and they're not they didn't ask for anything in advance so they're just doing things the quote unquote moral mold if there is I mean they they're doing things the right way they are uh you know taking everything off the plans they're taking every they take everything yeah they take they want everything they are
Jayson Roti
a certain amount they have all the stuff and uh and they have a schedule and their project manager is uh good so yeah a lot of times they want it like the next day or the next week whatever or sometimes they give you some time or sometimes they want it like right away and then all of a sudden they get there and they're like, oh we're on hold for another bump after you schedule them like very
Chi Ejimofor
So I I guess I guess that's the first one. I mean, how are they even so we send in the estimate? Um it doesn't seem like Uh it seems like there's like changes all the time. Okay, so generally what happens we send an SMF, blah blah blah. Who knows? But the point is somebody starts emailing somebody. Yep. Jared gets uh somebody Jared gets an email or you get a call or somebody gets something. Yep. There's like an assumption that we get that they're going with us. Right. And then people stuff starts happening at that point. So you'll look for estimates. Somebody will look for estimates.

Jayson Roti
it go find it um what do they normally want to start what's the starting uh all the swim stuff so it's gonna be sock rock entrance um Swap narrative, swip sign, dust sign, all that is like, all that is like super important right away.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, so there's like, but as far as like physical stuff, because like I guess we can start the sock
Jayson Roti
So S okay, uh SOC, whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
So they for they they want inst for installation.

Jayson Roti
They want installation, yeah, because otherwise they can't start. They need this on site before they can they they need the narrative. Before they can start? Yep, you're supposed to have this before you even touch the ground you're supposed to have the notice of intent which is you know showed you those things like the NOI is supposed to be in place the dust person or dust permit is supposed to be in place before you touch ground on the case.

Chi Ejimofor
So they can't okay they can't do anything they can they can. Okay, well they're not legally not supposed to be supposed to but they do. Okay.

Jayson Roti
Yeah but it this this book is supposed to be on site. The NOI is supposed to be pulled all that stuff
Chi Ejimofor
What do they like I mean if we say require like what what do they what okay so they like this they let's assume they they don't obey all the rules but what are they like hey I have to have this to start. I don't care.

Jayson Roti
The narrative, the sock.

Chi Ejimofor
So like this job site they got shut down this other day because they didn't have sock at uh so this SO this sock.

Jayson Roti
Compost filter sock. Yeah. So there's compost filter sock or silt fans. the BMP to go around the perimeter. Or they need temp fence. Like so temp fence will go up before you put sock in because otherwise if you put the sock in before the temp fence and the fence installers, they'll step on it and drive it and destroy it all.

Chi Ejimofor
So all the okay, so all the actual physical installation stuff that they need right away. If they okay, so they'll they need right away and they won't do anything, they shouldn't have anything started unless they have the physical installation.

Jayson Roti
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
They legally aren't supposed to do without the SWIP book, but they probably do. Yep.

Jayson Roti
And then they also need water on site, so they need a water meter, some sort of sour source of water.

Chi Ejimofor
They need that to start.

Jayson Roti
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
They most yeah, because you know And they will like I'm not saying need I'm saying they will not start the project unless they have it.

Jayson Roti
There some places may are requ not everyone, most places require to have the water like a water meter or something site. But sometimes they don't have any water on that site. So then we have to take our water sprucks and bring water to make sure that site is um watered down, keeping compliance for dust, you know, if they're just starting to generate dust so as soon as they start generating dust you have to have a water truck inside the floor as well and then you're probably gonna be starting to get like dirt and stuff in the road but then the super's easy probably because all the dirt's in the road is free sweep come and clean that up.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And that's all you it's like when we do a bit of S SPPP, does that usually include water shrug? Who knows?

Jayson Roti
Maybe it's not part of the water well, no.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, but that's stuff that you're gonna need. So like if once you start generating dust, you have to have water trucks. A lot of them almost make you have a water truck when you're putting a rock entrance. Not all of them. get away with it quite a bit. But some are sticklers that they need a water truck on site before you put like a rock entrance down.

Chi Ejimofor
Because all the dust is gonna be jumped. Are are we normally asking if they want water trucks? Okay.

Jayson Roti
Well no, um a lot of times you're the dirt the the so the person's gonna go on that site, they're gonna start rubbing the site, there's gonna be a dirt guy that goes on before. But when the dirt guy goes on, he he does like a perimeter swipe So we can put the sock or a fence in. Because you can't have bushes and trees around the perimeter where we're gonna put the sock. Like you can't zigzag. So they have to do that, ev even though the swip says you can't touch any grant until you have the swip. But you gotta get that shit out of the way so we can get fence and stuff in. Some sites doesn't matter. If it's a little bush, no big deal.

Chi Ejimofor
We see dirt guy. Is that our guys?

Jayson Roti
Nope. That's the like a dirt contract it's gonna go and level the project they're gonna like grade like they're gonna go in there like the bulldozers and the earth movers and they're gonna level it out get it ready and prepped for all the dirt whether it's elevation has to come up to go down, they get the they pull the curbs out, they get it all ready to go. And that's not us, but they usually have water trucks for themselves. Okay. Once the dirt guy comes off then we're gonna come in with a water truck. Like they may ask us to do water truck work um once the dirt guys come off. Like so uh WD red point like sorry red points of dirt contractor but they're out there doing all the stuff getting it ready and prep whatever they have their own water trucks yeah yeah okay
Chi Ejimofor
So they might not be they might not need a water from us. Yeah yeah. But they will need one.

Jayson Roti
You're right. But then they might need a street sweeper because Redpoint some of those guys don't have street sweeper, so then they call us. But that's not part of SWEP either. It's just part of you gotta keep the job set in compliance because you can have uh track out, not track out device, track out into the road with mud and dirt.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Is that usually part of the bid to water truck water truck stuff?

Jayson Roti
He'll put it in there.

Chi Ejimofor
He'll put like little pricing at the bottom, yeah. Is that something uh to I mean I guess sales, but is that something like if we get a contract? Is that something like if I'm getting if somebody yeah, me or if somebody if if I'm getting information and I'm Is that like hey do you guys have s you know, is it like yes you're checking the information but you're um getting information. Is that um something to ask?

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean yeah like hey you guys have something for water shots.

Jayson Roti
right up front.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean I mean you're but he's not talking to anybody for estimate.

Jayson Roti
He should be. You should be communicating with people. I think you should be communicating with people. A lot of times you can send them out but a lot of times you're communicating Communicating like so like a lot of times you have to communicate with a person when you're doing a schedule of value as to like why is a discrepancy there. You can go back and forth with email.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. After af well like once you get the contract you're going back and forth.

Jayson Roti
Right, but you usually like you you a lot of times you're talking You're still talking to that person. Like whoever's asking for that estimate, you're you're kind of talking to them. Like Jeff used to talk to him. Like and get information. Okay. Okay. Well, so I haven't seen him talk to anybody. more information out of them.

Chi Ejimofor
We have that bid, I don't know what that is, system. Uh I don't know some blue website, some website. Bid opportunities, some website that's blue beam.

Jayson Roti
It's a web uh he sent one several of them.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. He he okay, what is it? Uh Building Connected.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, yeah. What's yeah, so he's we get stuff off there, we get stuff off
Chi Ejimofor
Just a bunch of stuff. And that's not that's just like random yeah. Can them I mean so we have just yeah so it's like a we have like an infinite things to bid on for one because of repeat business. But and because of all these platforms as well. So they'll want to go ahead and start like so you can so you'll like go ahead and um do you need anything what do you need to okay Let's say they they're disobeying the rules, they don't want a contract. I mean they want a contract, but they're like we we need it.

Jayson Roti
Okay, so you go we're doing an insul I'm we're doing an email through selection.

Chi Ejimofor
We're doing an installation, so you need an uh you need an email but then approval You need an approval and then what else what it what information so you need like an address you need address, I need to know the job site, the site contact.

Jayson Roti
Um I need to know how much of whatever we're putting in, whether it's sock or rock entrance. putting temp fence in. I need to know are we putting, is it going to be pounded? Is it going to be on stands? Does it need privacy screening? It's half pounded, half on stands.

Chi Ejimofor
And that all that stuff changes the prices or they Yeah because if you pop if you have stands And they'll have their own privacy screens they'll buy or we have we provide do we have those?

Jayson Roti
So but if they're doing stands they're they're paying for sandbags. So if we're toning a pole that's included, but if we're doing sandbags and stands then it's extra because each
Chi Ejimofor
Sandbag is touched by and you're you're uh I guess whoever, but you're getting on the phone with they say, Hey, I need this stuff installed. You're getting on the phone and you're just going through line by line on the estimate. Like you need this.

Jayson Roti
I go through like whatever Jarrett and those two agreed like Whatever the like whether it's you and Kendra and Jarrett going through, like I should be getting the packet of
Chi Ejimofor
In the end you shouldn't you shouldn't have to talk to them. No, I should have I'll talk to them.

Jayson Roti
Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So the details of what when is is would be what you what would be in the best world you would just be worried about when
Jayson Roti
When and then when I get them on the phone I'm like okay so your inlets are already in. Are they have they been put in? Sometimes they haven't been put in like 'cause you s you gotta you gotta build the site and you gotta put the infrastructure underneath for inlets, drop inlets and curb inlets. Sometimes the curb inlets are in somebody else is doing this all this right but it could be an existing site like a Starbucks and the inlets there so then the inlets would be there. Yeah. So then I'm like okay your inlets already but if it's a site Where it's just dirt that are not even built yet. They're not even in there. So they're like at a later date. So what okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So you're asking do you have like a I mean, I guess it's in your in your soul at this point of what you're asking, but you know it's super So you yeah, uh I mean I'm gonna say in your soul like the questions that you're asking like uh but let's say um Yeah, what I guess what questions are you are you at like okay I mean we get the you'll you'll have the address in site contact even now you have it but um
Jayson Roti
I guess the specifics across the so you'll ask about you know like this little thing that's right here. Like if you come around here.

Chi Ejimofor
Are inlets installed already is one question.

Jayson Roti
So like right here. So sweat like I'll ask this guy. Install Let's see. So yeah. So can you know like remove like these other stuff uh
Chi Ejimofor
And you know how much of each thing install 1200 feet and um to temp fence details.

Jayson Roti
So like a lot of times I'll have in here, you know where it's highlighted stuff in red, at the office ready to install, so GCon. Uh okay. They're fourth elevator twenty feet. They're ready for the sock. Like hundred inches.

Chi Ejimofor
Ready for the sock means
Jayson Roti
Compost filter stock.

Chi Ejimofor
What do you mean what is it what does it mean they're ready?

Jayson Roti
That means they're ready for it. They're not even built yet, so now I have it say at a later date.

Chi Ejimofor
So do you you're asking them are you you would ask them are the inlets installed? Are you ready for the SOC?

Jayson Roti
And they would say yes, no. This is the date we should have it ready. the coordinator position they ask him is that stuff ready to go. Yep. So I know exactly what we're doing that day. Yep. It's like yes I'll get the whole thing but up you already know up front that okay they're not ready for that they're not ready for this. So So I know it right up front because otherwise then I don't have to ask them all the questions.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. Temp fence, how much of each thing is ready? Okay, so that's is that it's still kit. Okay. So are you ready for the rock entrance?

Jayson Roti
Because sometimes a dirt guy contracts hasn't been there to like, because we go out, like they have to prep the entrance to make sure it's ready, because we'll come out and put fabric down and then the rock on top Yep. I mean we could do minimal like digging dirt out if there curbs on the those are all questions I have to ask 'em.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and that's it? So rock and are are you ready for the rock inges? Are you ready for sock? And then are you ready for temp fence, is that a question or is it more like just tempfence details? Just in if they want everything. Okay.

Jayson Roti
A lot of times I wanna know is a temp fence up before I put the sock out because of the temp fence is not up. Then the people are putting whether it's us installing it, we were gonna put temp fence up first and then we're gonna put sock. If it's another installer for temp fence, we want them to put the temp fence up. Even though you're supposed to have the B and P's in, but if you put the temp if you put the sock in before the temp fence, the temp fence people drive over the sock and then they walk over and then they strike. the sock.

Chi Ejimofor
So the temp fence should be installed already.

Jayson Roti
It should well you want to do that first.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Sometimes they're not going to install first, sometimes they'll do it. It's up to them whatever they want to do.

Chi Ejimofor
So it would technically be like just it would be like the if we're not doing temp fence if it's not on there then it'll be like inlets and temp fence, you'd ask me about that, just And then to be to understand if they're ready for the SOC. Are you ready for the SOC? And Temp Fence slash BMP, what's a BMP?

Jayson Roti
So that's going to be through your compost filter sock, rock entrance, any of the things that we're going to do. Oh, you're just calling that's the it's called the best managed practices, housekeep general housekeeping is what they call it. So any of the services that we're doing with SWEP is called a bmp pretty much okay all right so so yeah like this is so section m in the narratives applicable bmps these are all this is all best management practices like this whole anything we do for 'em it's called a B and P. Rock entrance, silt fence, all of those.

Chi Ejimofor
And you just with the email they they send, you just need an email saying go ahead and do it. You don't that email doesn't need to say specifics.

Jayson Roti
That's if we don't have a contract, but we have a contract and those schedule the values of Jared Kendra or you sound like they're just figured that all out. Right now we're getting so many things from like Jared and then he's not matching up a schedule of values and then all of us are on this email, but we don't all need to be on the email. He just needs He like I said that dollar months off and this dollar months off, that dollar month should match before we even get anything.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
That has like so in Jefferson.

Chi Ejimofor
Ideally so ideally best world we would not even be Mm you would not have to bother with some of this stuff because it would already be iron dyed in the contract. You would just already have the contract and the contract would be like, alright, we have the contract already. So you know the amounts of everything. And you also know that would you know Temp Fence details in the contract?

Jayson Roti
Uh that's gonna well yeah. You're gonna look Jared or whoever was estimating?

Chi Ejimofor
That would be uh they're gonna know that. Like these do happen.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, be okay should be I need to know what's happening before so like I said like all these emails that are going with the soundtrack should be going I see, I see.

Chi Ejimofor
So how much and the temp fence details, like these should be that that should already be worked out. And it the only reason the only reason that you're involved is because somebody hit you up last minute and they're like, hey, I need this.

Lacie Slevin
two quick updates. One, um, that email's been sent. Okay. Um I see C too. Two, I just talked to Joel and reminded him that he needs to call Austin.

Jayson Roti
I told him maybe he left her to do it. I examined.

Lacie Slevin
I just got off the phone with Joel and Joel said that he called him and You know, he's called he called them right now at three thirty.

Jayson Roti
He was supposed to call 'em when he left here.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah. I know.

Jayson Roti
This is fail.

Lacie Slevin
So Okay. Well this is what it's Austin didn't pick up so I told you So you know, we need to know because who's going to be this guy for the SP for Monday and he knows Joe Moas, so anyways, um yeah, Joe will let us know a few years back from him.

Jayson Roti
Okay. So that's waiting for the thing.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, that's kind of good.

Jayson Roti
Because we need we need the guy because if those other two leave, we just just hire them.

Lacie Slevin
We're gonna be in a pickle.

Jayson Roti
Yep. Joel's not gonna I just say let's get the thing going.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, I I think that's
Jayson Roti
Yep, I'm like I'm not gonna wait for Joel. If he can't call him and then do it on time.

Lacie Slevin
I know.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, because we told him I told him this like five hours ago. And I'm sure I'm sure he's not having fun at Joe yet. Just get 'em maybe just let them know we're gonna extend except send an offer and try to come in for a drug screen. and all this stuff.

Lacie Slevin
Okay. Yep. Alright. Sounds good.

Jayson Roti
Thank you. Thank you, Jason. Yep. Okay. So you understand what I'm saying? Like so s like Don doesn't need all this stuff and stuff in until we know what we need. Yeah. But then I don't need to see it until all the negotiators
Chi Ejimofor
And the might be getting it like I mean what that's what that's the question, like what is that email?

Jayson Roti
What is that? that one I was showing you with all the um things he says hey just talk to him we might be getting it just uh put it on your radar but now I got it on my radar but now Um Jared, figure all the shit out. Figure all the other stuff out and not twenty emails coming back. I don't need to see those emails. Okay. Because it takes time out of it. Yeah. Because you think okay now I gotta interject but it's like I really don't need to inter interject because they need to match it all up.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Jayson Roti
It's like sometimes if you said they blast it all out, some people don't
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it's that that uh that final award okay now I've wasted five minutes doing this thing and it's the final like award award email or a final like thing of suc we need something. I don't know.

Jayson Roti
Just put this on your radar. I'll take
Chi Ejimofor
care of it from rest once I get it I'll send it to you.

Jayson Roti
Okay. So but then sometimes people in the email will say hey um it's not awarded but let's get this started. So okay that makes sense let's get the dust permit started let's get the spurt narrative going let's get all that going and then that makes total sense because that's kind of an approval saying get that started but I'll give you a contract for the rest of my sure what we're doing yet.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And that gets communicated with estimator or sales usually.

Jayson Roti
Or you even the sales people like I need them to like I need them to tell me how much they need I need them to send me an approval from I mean they can send to me and the super but I'm expecting them to finish the loop with the with the super to finish it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so it it is so it's always whatever that those like kinda pseudo award like before things, those are you're seeing them, but they are going to they need to close the load. Yeah, they're going to these guys first. Or in general.

Jayson Roti
I need to know what and how much and like where is it going.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so it's like you're getting you're getting these emails so Jared's getting these emails, sa uh sales they're getting the emails ever.

Jayson Roti
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
You're never getting the you're never getting communicated with like without them already. Are they would you ever find out that you're almost winning before them?

Jayson Roti
Sometimes. But then I'd send it to them to f
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
And sometimes I can just finish it and sometimes just easier, but I need to know I need the salespeople to close the loop as far as what they want and get that approval from that person. person because I gotta put it in the QuickBooks like I was showing you where you you for in case we get audited and stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah yeah. Okay, so then you have like basically a whole bunch of contract contract truing stuff but then at the very end then it's like Yeah, inlets, temp fence, and then you're ready for the rock entrance. Okay. Um That's all right. Uh and then Yeah So that's so that's and that's all the instant that's basically after that that's all the installation that's all your part basically. If once stuff once all that, let's say just physically, once those BMPs are installed. That's all done. That's you're finished uh physically at that point.

Jayson Roti
I'm done with that job until I call them up for uh rework or something but then the salespeeper or I mean sometimes the super just calls in for that and then I'm like I just need an email like how much sock you want. Sometimes they don't even want pricing.

Chi Ejimofor
They don't care
Jayson Roti
They just want it fixed.

Chi Ejimofor
Duntil rework and rework is uh generated by the email saying refresh the rock entrance. And that would that's fine just to come Yeah, and the and and the uh inspectors would be the ones that would like push them to do like not necessarily.

Jayson Roti
Well they may or they got hit by an inspector and our like the main inspector, not ours.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So and then rework, okay. Um So that's the physical
Jayson Roti
Ask away whenever you want. I'm just trying that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Hey Joel. Yeah. Okay, yeah, I count to Tanya. I told her to kind of go ahead because I we didn't hear from you. So but yeah, give her a holler. Okay, did anybody deliver that paint wash-up to um empty builders today? Well, yeah, we have to do that. And the delivery okay, there it is. Okay, I think should I put it on for Monday as well? We don't have much for Monday except for the Clayco, so it should be good, but we could find more stuff to do just so you know for Monday. Um because I've been um helping she with some stuff today so I wasn't able to like call a bunch of people Okay, I'll send this stuff out in just a little bit. Okay, I already told her to go through with it. Oh I know I told her to go through the way because we didn't hear from you. I guess Tanya's trying to call ya. Tanya's trying to call you. She had been. Okay. All right, let me know. Yep, Tanya's uh it's on Tanya's court. She's gonna get it all ready to go for him, so okay, cool. Bye-bye
Chi Ejimofor
Oh, that's who it was. Okay. Okay. Okay, and then for the book, the dust permit is needed before everything.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's the dust permit, then it's the
Jayson Roti
Trust permit, NOI.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh once they have the desk permit, they can start on the NOI.

Jayson Roti
No, you don't know. They just they can do the NOI. They could they have to file the NOI desk permit has not
Chi Ejimofor
So they should start NOI.

Jayson Roti
They they have to do the NOI. We can do the dust permit or they have it to do we could charge them for it. So Jared can do it or whoever. Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So the NOI, the GC should start that immediately. Dust permit needs to be done as well, us or them. And the NOI. After the NOI you can do the SW SWIP book. But then you know the SWIP book depends on both of those. You need both. Yes.

Jayson Roti
Um Oh well, he's busy. Sorry.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh, okay. And uh so once you have the NOI okay, let me see. Uh, okay. Wait, okay, yeah. Okay. Um You can start on the swip book and you can start on the the swip signs. Right.

Jayson Roti
Hey Craig, I didn't get your your voicemails kind of garbly, but yeah, I think you called from uh about picking up those two toilets, correct? Okay, yep, we got you on schedule for Monday for those two. I just wanted to make sure you're all good. So have a good weekend, buddy. Alright, thanks. Have a good one. Thank you.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, get the NOI, get the desk permit. Once those are in, then you can do the book and you can do the signs.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Yep, could we need a dust permit? Well I can do the book without a dust permit, but I mean if they have a dust sign, I need a dust permit, but I always ask for it because it helps with getting the book done. have to have a dust permit anyways.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. On your site. And you put you said the you don't you okay, you don't need it to start, but you need it to finish.

Jayson Roti
But that you need the you need the dust permit to finish the book. I don't need the dust permit at all. But it like so if Jurret doesn't have a plan or whoever doesn't of a plan. At least I can see where it's at on the plan, but they would like to have the dust permits in the book, but sometimes I don't get the dust permit from anybody. I for sure need the SWOP plan no matter what. I need the SWOT plan and I need the SWIP I need the NOI.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh what is needed for the SWIP plan to start? Anything?

Jayson Roti
Um normally when Jared does an estimate he has a swap plan.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Jayson Roti
Or sometimes it has a grinning and drainage.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, you mean you say swip well because I know there's a there's an engineering thing. And we have an engineering I know they contract it out, but that's like we have to ask somebody to do that.

Jayson Roti
That's not just like Like for a SWIP narrative I need a s I need a SWIP plan. So this grading and drainage plan wouldn't work. So Jared would see this is only grading and drainage gradage and draining plan. Like hey, do you have a SWIPT plan? I need that. Because you can do the takeoff off of this, but in order the narrative needs a SWIPT plan.

Chi Ejimofor
So the GC might have that. If they don't have it, then we just ask our guys to do it. And then you would like to have a plan.

Jayson Roti
I would like to well, I need the plan too. Well, I can make it, but at some point I need like for me to give them the book, I need a sweat plan.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, so it's required to finish.

Jayson Roti
Yep. Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so required to start and this is required to finish. This is nice to have. Okay.

Jayson Roti
What's up, beautiful girl? Are you just at home hanging? Okay. Alright, I know Bradley called. I was gonna call see what he needs, but I'll call him when I'm on the way home because I'm super busy right now. But if he wants to do something, Should I do it or should I just come home? Okay, I'll keep you posted what's going on, but I'd love to hang out with you more than Brad, so. Okay, I'll keep you posted. I love you. Get some rest Okay, love you too. Bye. My little girl. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And the SWIP plan the they do they always need fire signs, do they always need swip signs?

Jayson Roti
O They have need they do need a swip sign, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Always.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, well they should. Sometimes they'll make them themselves though.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then fire signs Is that somewhere?

Jayson Roti
Um they don't always need those, but most times they do.

Chi Ejimofor
Is that the so they will they would know? Yeah.

Jayson Roti
You would ask them.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah And sometimes they have their own peep person making the book, so it's like yeah, but they don't always they don't always need it, but most times we will do them
Jayson Roti
Excuse me. Thank you. All right. And I'm sure there's gonna be more you're gonna want to ask, so yeah
Chi Ejimofor
Um so if the sweat book gets done after all the physic if the switch book gets done after all the physical stuff is done then somebody just needs to drive over and give it to them.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, usually it's the inspector. Inspector. Yeah. Usually it covers on the side. side. Yeah, and sometimes the source signs and stuff and uh dust signs get done afterwards. They're supposed to happen, but like since we're outsourcing them now, sometimes it might take a little bit longer. Longer, which is fine.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And you just have to tell the inspectors is there.

Jayson Roti
But you you'll just tell them and they'll put it on the SWAT master because I send the SWIPMA to the other.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah, yeah. So you'll have to um Okay, and then the are the inspectors on every job that we do slip on?

Jayson Roti
No So it says if they're in that area then we can deliver it.

Chi Ejimofor
Or I mean sorry, not every uh okay.

Jayson Roti
So they're not always on a job, but I mean if they're close by they can deliver them
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so as part of this the whole thing, um the ins the uh uh is set what if the inspectors are start required to start?

Jayson Roti
Uh once the NOI is filed.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jayson Roti
But the customers don't always approve that.

Chi Ejimofor
What does that mean? What do you mean?

Jayson Roti
Um they could pull NOI and you're supposed to technically start the inspections, but sometimes if um customers like I'm not paying for you if there's maybe touch the ground so why? But you're supposed to, but you can't always make a con general contractor do that. Technically once the NOI is pulled, you're supposed to start doing inspections, but there's no dirt being done. They don't want to pay to have that done.

Chi Ejimofor
You're supposed to start inspections like the immediately like the first week or like within two weeks?

Jayson Roti
The NOI.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So mm so that's one of those like mm, yeah.

Jayson Roti
Okay, so just whenever they start, you so you have to know it's like two weeks after you reinstall. when we go out there. Two weeks after we installed we install ya.

Chi Ejimofor
Um It would never start before, generally.

Jayson Roti
Uh well like I said, once we get the NOI Sometimes they do. A lot of times a customer doesn't want to pay for that. Technically it's supposed to, once you get to NOI, it's supposed to be like two weeks after you get it. But there's so many times people could have had them for six months and they're not even doing it. So most time the customer's not going to pay for it because they haven't touched the ground. Yeah. They'll pull the NOI, but they haven't touched the ground, so like I'm not going to have anybody come inspected that there's they haven't done anything.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So but once you start touching the ground and moving dirt, then you definitely have to who's commu is somebody communicating with them about that?

Jayson Roti
Um they I suppose the inspector could because the inspector knows once we have like once an NOI is pulled once I because I may not get that NOI because that NOI could have been
Chi Ejimofor
around for like three months. Who gets? I mean is there a notification system? Is there something?

Jayson Roti
No, because it comes so once the job is started. These guys may have pulled the NOI before we even did the estimate.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So there's no way to know. No. Unless they tell you.

Jayson Roti
Yep. Yeah. So that would be so once I get the NOI and sometimes like I said they could have had this at NOI for six months months.

Chi Ejimofor
And we b so theoretically, but theoretically somebody like sales or project coordinator or estimate would be aware of that the project that the project is going or something is happening.

Jayson Roti
Right. If there's job sites going, there's a job site trailer there. But a lot of times this stuff's not gonna if there's nothing on the site, they're not gonna nobody's gonna know Like that site if there's if nothing's been moved, there's no trailer on it, nobody's gonna know.

Chi Ejimofor
Would they communicate that we won or contract or anything like that before?

Jayson Roti
the estimate sometimes that that thing's done before well usually they're gonna have that they're gonna make sure they have the contract in their hand before they come to us. But sometimes that's like as soon as they get it they maybe go start And then they start the bid process later. So that could be a thing where they're like, oh, we're ready to go. Like I got this radius, they were ready to go two months ago.

Chi Ejimofor
And they're like, oh, we're not ready yet.

Jayson Roti
We're not ready. Not ready.

Chi Ejimofor
But they'll just say like that day that they call. So that's a question whenever anybody gets some sort of contact, it's like do you have an NLI? It's just a question at the beginning.

Jayson Roti
Or what's the plot what's the plan for that?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So somebody yeah, whenever you get some that pre-communication, whatever that is.

Jayson Roti
Pre-communication is gonna start the process. So and then you're gonna see when the NOI was started and you you know you could go back to the date it was but But like I said, most customers aren't gonna pay for it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, it's not like a I guess not a big super deal, but uh would be a s I guess it's uh if they want to start inspection sooner then
Jayson Roti
then it's free money, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. For whatever reason, I guess. Like for the dirt people, they like should be going out there, I guess. already.

Jayson Roti
If dirt people yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Like if the dirt people start. They theoretically. Okay. But we wouldn't know until all that stuff is done.

Jayson Roti
No, not until we start asking for it. Because we have to start like once we get the bid then we're gonna start asking.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so we they only they might bid out later or just whatever the dirt's already done, all this stuff. Who knows? It's just okay. Uh okay, cool, cool, cool. All right, right, okay, okay, okay, and okay, physical environment Um, okay. Uh, okay. And other things being on the contract, if that's water trucks or anything else, that's up to those people to get in touch and figure out something that Jared should be asking right up front, like are you guys ready for this?

Jayson Roti
Like when you're doing a their contract. Those are questions I start asking right away. Are you ready for fence? You know, do we win the fence? You know, hey we have fence, we can put fence in there as well. Those are stuff that we should be asking when we're doing the estimate, which I think he does. I've heard heard him say it to ask.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah, I guess other
Jayson Roti
Uh of shit isn't there.

Chi Ejimofor
And they usually make schedules like after everything or they'll it's part of their own master or whatever.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Yep, it's probably uh after bid after bid awards themselves. I mean that that schedule's change until I mean they may have a funding issue. They may have all that, yeah. And that's out of our control.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, I think that makes sense.

Jayson Roti
Oh yeah, I'm just building the three for for this is for Saturday work. And then I'm gonna do this one for ten twenty-seven. Continue. So guys we'll see it. See how it's gonna go.

Chi Ejimofor
Is it cool to just like if we just go you know I guess if we get it we have to get approvals but once we get like kind of approvals and stuff Like go ahead and buy signs and bill for 'em? Or should we be waiting until something else?

Jayson Roti
Or usually wait till we get the contract or some sort of approval safe. go for it.

Chi Ejimofor
So if you get a contract, so once you get a contract we could just we could through I mean if you have the other stuff. Yep.

Jayson Roti
But I need the like I said I need the I w I can't make a sign until I have The NOI or I can't make a fire sign unless I know which address is this gonna be. Is it what which side of the street is it's gonna be? Yeah. Yeah, so then you need all that stuff before we can do it. So that's the information like once we win the That stuff should be going out to the customers so we know how we're ready to go. So like this one here. So I gotta split this one. So this is a pain in the ass. Lots of time.

Chi Ejimofor
You got that from a uh an estimate at some point. This thing? Yeah. Yeah. And I had to type all of it in. Which is you know and the gate code and all that stuff was in this within the contract rest.

Jayson Roti
No, nobody had asked for that. The guy just gave that to me. So That's going to be there. And now for this one, because it's a rock entrance, I gotta add a different line from this one. So Daniel and Dalton can see it. So I'm gonna pull all this the shit out of here. So that shows I need a rock entrance. I know that that shows I gotta order a rock for it. And it's just shit I got remember okay so for okay ready to install on ten twenty seven and then I gotta put uh Dalton by Daniel
Chi Ejimofor
How do you know how much uh let's say okay so you have contract stuff uh okay so you I can ask are you ready and stuff but I guess uh say they're ready for everything
Jayson Roti
How do you know yeah how much how do you know well how do you know how much rock uh how much rock like literally that we have like how many twenty two tons.

Chi Ejimofor
How how do you uh do we buy it all in it uh like do we have it sitting here all always or do is it all so we used to have a dump truck and I used to uh Toby deliver it now we don't have the dump truck
Jayson Roti
anymore. So now we have to go through a company. They they buy the rock from a place that we have an account and then they deliver it.

Chi Ejimofor
So so we and that can be done same day, it doesn't matter.

Jayson Roti
Uh usually sometimes not like when I we have the dump truck yeah Um we never know what the delivery service has. They may have a ton of stuff and we may not be able to get it that day. So it's okay, so that's and Daniel calls that morning to see if we have we have a truck ready to go for. Like we'll we'll call this all in and we pay per hour. for the truck.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you'll call in the morning. Can you guys can you guys get rock can you get So he calls them to buy rock and then they deliver.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. So
Chi Ejimofor
So you like to do everything on the same day, theoretically.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, absolutely. So now I gotta pull this thing back over here. because they don't need to know that. Because Daniel's gonna take care of it or Dalton. So it takes time to schedule this stuff too.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's for rock installs. Uh you have to buy the rock and then they deliver the same day and you need that's just a uh You need extra peop you need extra people to go on site to do that or is like that's two crews?

Jayson Roti
Whoever has a tractor. That would be Dalton and Daniel or whoever as long as Dalton shows up.

Chi Ejimofor
So Dalton will do the rock stuff.

Jayson Roti
Yep, Dalton will be rocked by himself.

Chi Ejimofor
And they that's them okay. And then for the main Uh for the B and Ps, right? Is that what you call 'em?

Tim Haitaian
Yeah, BMPs, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
For the main B and Ps. How do you know I mean, we I see a bunch of fence out there, I mean How do you do you know how much we have out there ready to go?

Jayson Roti
Is that somewhere? Um Jared should know how much fence we have because he's been ordering it. So if we're gonna do a big job, we gotta make sure we have a normally we have a bunch of fence, so a lot of times we have to go out and count to make sure we have enough. And if we don't have enough fence, then we gotta order the fence to make sure we for each job. So we kind of have to go out and do inspections of how much fence we have.

Chi Ejimofor
So Jared theoretically knows the capacity of fence in it. Is it should.

Jayson Roti
We should know how much fence or if we have to place an order for some
Chi Ejimofor
So it's gener okay, so it should like some like if we win something that amount should be subtracted or something.

Jayson Roti
You know, it should be like a way to track it. So we know what we're up against.

Chi Ejimofor
different socks. So for main BMPs estimator should know uh uh knows the capacity and Uh if we have everything then is there then then the guy then those teams or go out and install uh
Jayson Roti
And there's more to it.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm just giving you I'm giving you most of the stuff I'm I mean the more to it like What what's the well I guess there's a bunch of is it like you mean the more to it like there's a bunch of extra stuff that could happen?

Jayson Roti
This is this is just like the scheduling and stuff. Like there's gonna be I I'll be able to tell you more stuff I do. Um it's just this is like what I've been doing today to get shit done. Yeah. But yeah, this is the gist of getting stuff done for scheduling and everything and making sure we have
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. There's more stuff you so you're saying there's more s there's like a lot of rand a lot of stuff you do. Yeah, yeah, that's we'll we'll put we'll moving that, we're moving that over there. So this is all swept up.

Jayson Roti
This is mostly swept, yeah. Yeah. I think I've covered most of it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So main BMPs, if we have a capacity, if it's everything's available, team goes out and installs it. Or they they they call they call first. Right.

Jayson Roti
They're gonna call but most of us would be contract. If not, it's gonna be called in. But then I need approvals for all of it.

Chi Ejimofor
They call first a check.

Jayson Roti
Whatever they need, whatever BMP they want or whatever Rock entrance or temp fence move or the wind blew the thing down and I gotta like get out there.

Chi Ejimofor
Um as a as a final check those guys always kinda call or is it the supervisor or
Jayson Roti
Wait, do we have like super that call?

Chi Ejimofor
He's the main Yeah, but Joel's not gonna know.

Jayson Roti
I'm gonna call it about Joel. Joel's not they're they might call Joel, but then Joel calls me and tells me to call Super. And then I gotta get a hold of the super, then I gotta get him to tell me what he wants.

Chi Ejimofor
Wait, so uh they do call they call me a lot, yeah.

Jayson Roti
Wait wait, no, sorry. They when those super call me.

Chi Ejimofor
Those guys they call to check if they're ready for install before they go out. I think that's what he said. So they so we will just we're like assuming installation we're gonna go out unless we're calling before we go. We do call before we go. Yes. We're gonna try to call it.

Jayson Roti
And if they can't get a hold of him, I try to call it.

Chi Ejimofor
Joel or so whoever's the lead.

Jayson Roti
It was Joel they got Joel, Justin, and Jair, which Jair's lead, but now it's Preston. So they're all supposed to call.

Chi Ejimofor
And those are the crew leads. Those are like the heads of the little thing.

Jayson Roti
Ready to go, which happens a lot.

Chi Ejimofor
Final check. Okay. Okay. You when do you print you you give you print these out in the m you you arrive in the morning and print these?

Jayson Roti
No, I've usually tried printing them. I start trying to build it during the day, but I guess can I give bothered because I'm not bothered but I get interrupted so much. So but you'll print it I start printing it at by the end of the day like so sometimes I'm not in here till six thirty trying to get this shit out.

Chi Ejimofor
So they will be so all the all the orders will be sitting here. I try. I didn't I mean I try.

Jayson Roti
Like so over the weekend I might have other ones I send and I send them to Joel and Jair and the Bleak But they never checked your fucking email. Yeah. So then I'm like the day is I'm like, well I have two more, like where are they? And they well I didn't see my email, but you're supposed to look at your email every day
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So generally uh the okay There's a lot of like hiccups for it. On the day of install you'll uh have printed what do you call these?

Jayson Roti
These are uh um schedules. Work like work uh uh work description schedule. I guess it's the schedule So as you see this takes some time to do.

Chi Ejimofor
And do you like do they just like do they just hand it to each like it doesn't matter who does what or um they'll be saying like there's one on there that says first and then these other ones are some smaller
Jayson Roti
jobs or it's just kind of filling as they're driving to the site. Like two of these were canceled today which I'm adding on right now. because they weren't ready or the super wanted to go home because it's Friday and we're scheduled we're ready to go but we called ahead and now that gets pushed for the next week or the next next day then it was the schedule's already pretty full so then it fucks up the next the next
Chi Ejimofor
And do you just call those guys and and say hey we're gonna have to move you down?

Jayson Roti
The um uh I make the um leads call them. And if they can't get a hold of them, we usually call them when we get back, when they get back to the office here. And we try to get a hold of them and let them know why. You know, hey, we tried calling you, you didn't answer your phone. Sometimes they I don't want to answer the phone because I think it's a telemarketer. And then I usually call and sometimes Bob would have my phone number
Chi Ejimofor
And there's no real there's no there's no
Jayson Roti
Prioritization necessarily it's just like prioritization is like uh this has to be done first, this one like this one. I don't know where it was. Oh like Claiko. This has to be first thing in the morning. WD, these just have to be done. This is gonna be uh some are gonna be done by Dalton Because it has to do with the tractor winding the thing.

Chi Ejimofor
What's like what's like has yeah. So what's then is it gets what's like has to be done like if something's on the like between like what seven and eight.

Jayson Roti
So this is the first one this will be the first one they do. First First uh site to visit. And then you kind of go there and then you're coming back. You hop on the other ones. Like these aren't the most urgent, but this Claiko one is Then the WDs are important pri uh primark would be morning.

Chi Ejimofor
So they'll call and push, but if some if one of the guys is like I like nah we need this then you'll like keep them on or something
Jayson Roti
I'll try to get it done, yeah. Yeah. But it depends on they'll have to like push back or something to sometimes like I said these two guys push because they wanted to go home but
Chi Ejimofor
Sure. And I we're real we're willing to still go out there, but they don't they want to they want to Will you like call other people to see if they're ready or something to fill it back in?

Jayson Roti
Like we called two other people and they wanted to go home too.

Chi Ejimofor
It's a Friday.

Jayson Roti
I mean and the peop those guys have been there since probably three in the morning.

Chi Ejimofor
Right. You know, we we're still ready to go, but they're ready to go home and So if somebody cancels, you are immediately or somebody is immediate well, I guess you are you immediately like you you come in
Jayson Roti
Two cancellations or do you find out you don't find out unless Joel and those guys are supposed to be texting me as part of their job to let me know. But if I don't get a text, so once we get a system that will say like where they're at and like this busy busy at I can start seeing where they're at. They're supposed to text and uh when they get done with their job. So I know they're done. I'm like okay where are you going next? I'll ask Where are you going next? But then I know where they're going for the next job. Or this guy called and canceled. Now we're going to this one next. So but if we had an app Like crow.

Chi Ejimofor
What was the reason why you couldn't use crow to dispatch? There's no reason why. We just haven't done it. Okay.

Jayson Roti
Yeah. Um I haven't done it. Yeah. So in a lot of it's like somebody's gotta put the information in. Yeah. They might not put all the accurate information because you're gonna have to put all this work completed. stuff in there and sometimes you know let me sum like the PG the the like those guys out there the leads. Yeah. Yeah. Like information's only as good as what you put in. Yeah. So sometimes like I'll get stuff in here and I gotta like Like it's like a charades game trying to figure out what they wrote down.

Chi Ejimofor
Do they so they write on these? Mm-hmm.

Jayson Roti
Yep, they'll write on those.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, there's a bunch of sections.

Jayson Roti
So this is all the stuff I gotta like I this is all the stuff so I gotta differentiate all the stuff that they've done. Then sometimes like installed twenty-five screens. Okay, well it's twenty-two screens or fifty screens. They're supposed to be writing how many lineal feet? Pounded ten new twelve new poles. So they were there twice, so we got two visits that I gotta do the time for it. So I gotta go through and so if they're doing all that stuff on the thing, like a crow app wouldn't be able to It would be almost like a big thing.

Chi Ejimofor
I guess you know the crow app I've never used I've I haven't had the training or anything.

Jayson Roti
It almost needs to be like a McDonald's app. feet like it's a hamburger I want pickles lettuce and mayonnaise on it like oh he they wanted oh they wanted screen on this this is how much screen I put on but it's like it's almost like a You gotta make it easy like a McDonald's app.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. So the crow is more complicated.

Jayson Roti
I don't know, but it's never been built for like a swip. It's more for
Chi Ejimofor
They just go to one thing and they say I'm here and then that's it type of thing. Yeah.

Jayson Roti
So I don't know how it will work with um I don't know because they've it's nothing that they've Crow hasn't done SWIP. Like they're they haven't developed into SWIP. Yeah, it's just yeah, I guess it's like the idea the so the Titan service Titan might work better for it, but it's like for smaller scale.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. So the idea is just in general that they're able to enter like line by line.

Jayson Roti
To make it work.

Chi Ejimofor
And those other uh I was gonna say the other two people that are kind of manual, the sweeper and the water trucks that we've got.

Jayson Roti
And those could probably all be in those could probably probably all be in um crow. Yeah. Absolutely.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
The only and the mean it's just like the crow just you got started once for if I go to some All of these jobs. So say if Kelly had a job that oh we were already on this one. So all you gotta do is reactivate that thing and it brings it all up and has all the information you need on it. So it's all it's already built in there. Yeah. So like a lot of times you can have repeat. So oh you have repeat. So I guess I have to learn.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean you said react you you reactivate uh inactive looking at the right.

Jayson Roti
So like this one here, sorry oh I need a sweeper over nine nine nineteen thirty-five Hayden. So I can click on that 19358 and there's nothing in there but I've had all information from the last time I was there. Yep. This one doesn't have any notes, but then I could go and like oh I'm gonna put him in a toilet over there. Or I need a sweep out there. Yeah. But now let me go back to 1935. I gotta get rid of it because I gotta deactivated it in 1935. So there's nothing in there, so now I'm gonna go summon asphalt. Then I'm gonna deactivate it. So but if you but oh I I need a water truck. Oh there it is. I was just out there the other day. Just reactivate the thing and put the new water truck thing in. Or you can keep them all in there if they're active. You know, like if it's uh you know this one needs to be serviced. Come on down So there's 1020 we just delivered that one that's not a good one So there's like all the stuff every time we've serviced them so I would show every time the driver was there because they have to like log in and say it is if there's notes, you know, they want about two-time service if you just keep notes there for building the stuff up on top.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, I'll have to I'm gonna tell uh with Karen to schedule a a thing for me.

Jayson Roti
She's good at it, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay, so the other and I know so Daniel and Yeah they would just have to use Crow. They would have to use.

Jayson Roti
But you you have to be other you can't I don't I don't know if Krill works on Apple, but it it works on a PC, so you have to have a PC if he's out in the field.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jayson Roti
Otherwise, you have to do a lot of it from here.

Chi Ejimofor
And like when we prefers I was gonna say like is there well I mean it's I think it's because he's like uh he knows how to do everything. Is that yeah he's a director is there any I mean he just is he like to be out there is there any Uh you just know yeah, I gu well the question is he's a d he's like I don't know, uh I think a lot of his time could be just scheduling stuff and working on in in office stuff, right?

Jayson Roti
Yeah, he's out in the field a lot.

Chi Ejimofor
But he likes to be out there, yeah. He said I got secrets to be able to run it run stuff on on here. It's not a We can well I have to get this these guys CMIT to buy the thing but uh if they ever if they get back to me I called them called them uh Uh I gotta call 'em again, maybe. Wonder if they would get back to me on Um, okay. Crow app. Um And do we just have uh w you just is it easy to add licenses to this crow thing?

Jayson Roti
Yeah, it's easy to do that, yeah. So they have a web is it on the web license. Karen's done it quite a bit
Chi Ejimofor
Um dispatch billing driver app CRM dispatch monitor hauler app nice So it's uh you're so we use dispatch, I guess, right?

Jayson Roti
Do you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Nice. Alright, well figure out
Rick Haitaian
Hello.

Jayson Roti
Hey, how you doing buddy? Hey Jason L, you know where Steffen is at? He's waiting right in the back or turn us to sit. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
You still go out on the boat, uh Rick? No more.

Jayson Roti
Alright. Sorry, I got you all good, y'all good.

Chi Ejimofor
I think I got I think I got everything for the for the main understand how those of it works.

Jayson Roti
Right, I get these things out by five or those. That'll be able to give you more stuff too.

Chi Ejimofor
So yeah, yeah, more about yeah.

Jayson Roti
Yeah, I gotta get those and you gotta be out of here by five.

Chi Ejimofor
So You put over. Okay, and we should be
