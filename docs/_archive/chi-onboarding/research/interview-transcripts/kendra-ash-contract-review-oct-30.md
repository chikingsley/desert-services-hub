# Kendra Ash Contract Review - October 30

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Oh, I just got booted out. That's probably why. Okay. Hold on, I gotta log back. I've gotten booted out probably 15 times today. I don't know why I have a bad connection. For some reason. Don't do. So hold on one second.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
How's your day going?

Chi Ejimofor
How's your day going?

Kendra Ash
But you did just it doesn't look like it's cold in the office yet.

Chi Ejimofor
It's it's you don't have your scarf and jacket. I listen I have the scarf and jacket in the corner right there. Um's not in. Yeah Dawn's in dawn's out the next two days. But I have my heater and I got my scarf and jacket right there. I'm and I had it in them on in the morning. I'm just It was too it was too hot, which is good, so then we're regulating and but probably I like to just be bundled. Yeah, I like to just be bundled
Kendra Ash
Okay, share screen. Okay, here I go.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you have the Bell Road one? Okay, uh I should I should pull you up. I'm gonna pull you up on the big screen. If I pull you up on the big screen, I might even be better. Okay. Okay, you're on the Bell Road one. Okay. Where can I have that one? I almost have uh I know how to set up QuickBooks now. I just don't have it set up yet. Oh yeah, I need a uh oh is Dawn in? Wait, let me just run over and see if Dawn I'll go. Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay, I'm back. Okay. Don Don said he's on it in the next hour and a half so, so.

Kendra Ash
Is he getting you a desktop computer or something?

Chi Ejimofor
Getting me one, no, but I'm I'm stealing one from Oh, okay. Okay. I'm stealing one. They got and also I know how to If I can figure I uh there's like one issue yeah if I can figure I need to figure out how to uh it's a whole thing I know how to but I know I can understand how it works um But yeah, now I just need to Oh the remote login thing. Yeah, I I understand how it works. Not the remote yeah, to remotely log into the computer I I might need uh Extra help with that but I I think I know how but I think I can figure it out.

Kendra Ash
Because they tried um putting Tim's dad, Rick, they tried putting QuickBooks on his computer without him remotely logging in and they could not do it.

Chi Ejimofor
Well yeah, you can't do it because it's it's on the local shared
Kendra Ash
I mean maybe there's a so we'd probably we'd probably only do it if we had QuickBooks Online, which we're not gonna change to because we just want to change to something completely different if we change
Chi Ejimofor
Is Quick Oh, I see.

Kendra Ash
Is it a comp I feel like it's a It's totally yeah, QuickBooks Online is totally different So it's like a whole different system. So it's not like we can just transfer over, you know? So that's just not we might as well just if we're gonna change we might as well just get something
Chi Ejimofor
She showed me your sight line. I was like why are I was like why are we not using sightline? Sightline looked nice. They had they had the retaining they had retainage in there automatic.

Kendra Ash
I I because we don't connect anything to QuickBooks. So everything we use, we just have to put it in another area. So it's like you know, we're already putting it in several different locations and then That's just another one 'cause we don't connect anything.

Chi Ejimofor
Silence. You can.

Kendra Ash
You can connect it to QuickBooks. Just like um you can with um Crow, but we just don't. So we just so they'll do it all manually.

Chi Ejimofor
And is um is that for safety or something?

Kendra Ash
I don't know. I just don't well we just never did before, but I don't know I don't know. But I'm not really sure why.

Chi Ejimofor
I just I saw Sightline. I was gonna talk because I looked up a couple I was like cause I was looking through stuff to like You know, I'm just looking at a bunch of different things, just talking to people. And I was looking at some, you know, different apps and things and And then I'm talking I was talking to a couple guys and then I saw the sight light and I was like, this is we already pay for it. This is what these guys are off. These other guys are talking about doing this exact same thing
Kendra Ash
And Silent looks pretty, works and there that I know we don't use it for anything right now. We use it to do change order requests and then some of my the manual pay apps. But that's it. And there's a bunch of stuff in there we could be using it for and it's not cheap. either.

Chi Ejimofor
How m yeah, and that's is it a per user thing, right?

Kendra Ash
Um no, no. I don't think I don't I think anyone can use it because yeah everyone's on it. Karen, Don TM me and it doesn't matter. It's just one price. It's a year. I think it was like eleven thousand dollars or something.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, sounds about right. That's interesting. So Yeah. I wonder what the But if we used it for that's what I was thinking.

Kendra Ash
The only reason we got it is because our last accountant, she was locking us out immediately and we had no way of doing change orders which they still don't like we can send them in there but we still have to track them in QuickBooks so it's not really changed much but um Otherwise we don't really use it. You know, we d it's not worth the money, but if we actually looked into that's why I wanted I need to get some of the stuff off if I got some of the stuff on me I could start working with it and looking at it more because I've just not even had any time. But I'm sure we could use it for You know, it could maybe be good for us if you're and I also do you okay, uh this is we'll get we'll get to the contracts in a second.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you fill out this G702 and G703 forms and send it to what is this? Because it's for the AIA billing. You've so you do you do this?

Kendra Ash
Yes Yes? Oh so that's what we have to I have to do everything in in QuickBooks on invoice first and then just to track it for us and then because they don't The contract owners never see the invoices we have in QuickBooks. They only see the pay apps, the AIA forms.

Chi Ejimofor
And you uh so you have to fill out those two forms and you put it in their pay app thing whatever it is.

Kendra Ash
That is the that is the AI.

Chi Ejimofor
Those two forms is the pay app it's like integrated it's integrated into the pay apps.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Hmm. I was reading online, uh I was reading online and they were saying that there's like every time you bill, you're supposed to Like multiply it whatever you're billing by the re I don't under I didn't understand it fully, but it was like you're supposed to like There's like a way you're supposed to do it with to put the retainage and then you add up the retainage and then at the end you like charge it all the same the retainage Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yes. And that's why you use the AIA form because you can um like Then that's how you can track. Let me go to sight line real quick.

Chi Ejimofor
Um man I ran out of too where am I?

Kendra Ash
Oh I'm in a contract.

Chi Ejimofor
Sorry, uh I thought I was doing trying to make a this thing.

Kendra Ash
Okay. site line I'll show you because that's why it makes a lot more that's why you kind of have to use them some companies will let us not and they'll just you do it on their end and track it but then you miss a lot like okay here's LGE um here's their schedule of values So here's the schedule values. It'll show you what was what's the original contract of 18,825. And then every line item of what you built to date. So we build the narrative, we build partial of SOC, we still have $3,300 of SOC left remaining. We haven't done any inlet protection yet. We've done the sign, the spill kit, we've done some inspections and one used one MOB. And then as every month that you do it, then you do the next month and then it keeps adding and then here's the retainage that it tracks. So so far, oh my god, there's a ton of turkeys in my front yard. Um so and then it tracks it as you go. the entire you know and then when we run out of money you can always tell that oh shit you know we're almost out of money with inspections and that's when you have to contact the customer and say okay how much longer is the job gonna be or you know if they want some more They want to rock entrance and oh this customer doesn't have that, so you have to change order, add that in. And but that's the point of the AIA. It tracks everything you do through the entire link of a job and tracks the retention. So let me show you an actual pay app just. Because that was just the schedule values. Here is the G forms that get sent in. So here's the front sheet which you know shows the original amount what's completed and then here's the retention and then every month This changes, which you probably can't really see this that much, and then here's your schedule of values again. And it you know, it shows everything from previous application this period retention to date, balance left to complete, and saying that that's how it's tracked every through the job.

Chi Ejimofor
Well Yeah. It sounds I mean I don't know. It it it looks pretty, uh, and it I don't know, I think it's secure, I don't know how the QuickBooks works It's magic.

Kendra Ash
Um oh yeah, QuickBooks doesn't do any of that's the problem. QuickBooks doesn't do anything that has anything to do with any of this. Change orders, pay apps, that's what our problem is. There is other software out there that does. But it doesn't. So we have to track it completely separate.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's interesting. I yeah. Alright, well that maybe that's a question for Don or something. I'm like what yeah, this one looks nice. I I don't um And it can do attachments and everything, I I assume. Order organized by j organize by job, organized by contractor, anything like that.

Kendra Ash
I mean, yeah, this could probably do a ton of stuff But we don't use it for pretty much anything right now except for my manual billing and for us to send change order requests to people. Can you and but but you still have to keep them in QuickBooks to track them anyway, so it doesn't really Help. It's kinda it was just yeah, it was something we needed before, but it's not really working the way we want it to. But
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, even now, okay, does it have can you organize by oh god dang it?

Kendra Ash
I just got kicked out again. Hold on Can I organize by what?

Chi Ejimofor
Uh by what's it called? Um Yeah, can you see contractor names in there I guess?

Kendra Ash
Yes, yes, I'll show you that in a second once it comes back up Here, I'm sending you a picture of the turkeys that are outside my window right now.

Chi Ejimofor
So you live out you live you live outside. Oh you live outside.

Kendra Ash
I live in Heber.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know what that is
Kendra Ash
It's do you know where Pi for Payson or Solo is?

Chi Ejimofor
I heard about uh I think Wendy said she lived in Solo.

Kendra Ash
I but Yes, Wendy lives in Solo. I still I don't know what I live in I like it like in between Yeah, I live the bottom an hour from Solo. Kind of yeah, in a little tiny town where we have nothing, really. Yeah, so I always have deer and turkey and birds and stuff of all kinds in my front yard. while I'm working. So it's kind of cool. But okay, so on here, here's all the customers Well here's the customer well the job names with the customer names you can um sort by customer you can sort by jobs you can filter so what's kind of cool in here like I can go in and filter and I can do Everything that's in GC paid and just gonna be a good thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh man, so wait, you can pay those contracts. I was like, you can pay No, no, this doesn't make sense now. Okay. It makes sense, but it doesn't make sense. So you can use this to pay every single person that you don't have to you know you have to log in and do all this stuff, but you can use this. to invoice and pay directly to every person and organize them by the thing that they well want.

Kendra Ash
Kinda but not really. So even though so I don't really I was I started using this for texture and GC pay But it doesn't matter because you still have to get out of it. So you put it in here and then it connects you to those websites and you still have to go in there and do the same thing
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, but it's it doesn't do a When you say do the okay so it doesn't like directly integrate per se, but it gives you a it organizes it and gives you a link at least. So you don't have to like remember or something.

Kendra Ash
Yes, yes, so That's what I was thinking when we were doing it like when looking at this. So like if you had project managers or someone looking here, you could link everything because you don't actually want them getting into the billing systems, you know, GCPAY and Texture and stuff. But they can go in everyone can go in here and see what's left in the schedule of values, what's you know, what change orders are outstanding, all of that.

Chi Ejimofor
Honestly, yeah. That was what I was I was like because I don't I don't personally like as a you know short term coordinate you know I well long term I don't know whatever as the coordinator project manager thing I'm like I don't really want to submit invo I don't want to do anything. Or, you know, I we used to, but you c I don't know, there's various levels. But like theoretically I should just be focused on managing the project. And billing and that you guys should be involved. But it's like I should I still need to know all this stuff. And I still need to organize, you know. So this is like the perfect way to kind of balance. Um Yeah, um I don't maybe Yeah it could be yes it could be very useful to us did you guys ever did you did you get a training on this from somebody at the that this company
Kendra Ash
Ever or well we can get more because the only thing we ever got trained on I mean we got trained on very limited because we don't use anything else. But we can get additional training on any time we want.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
So And yes, I think we could use it for a lot more. Even Karen and Don, I mean, I honestly just showed them recently how they could even log in and look at because they don't they've never done AIA billing either. Yep. So um when they're wondering, you know like Karen, every once in a while we have to do concrete washouts in the contract And she's like, well, she never knows if we have any left. And I'm like, well, you can go in here anytime you want. And look it up and can see, you know, 'cause they can't get into the billing systems, but they can get into here, which can give anybody. Jason could look in here and see what's available and what we still have money avail you know, 'cause he has to ask a lot of times 'cause the customers want to know before they order it. And he could just go in here and look at that schedule values and see what's left. And it would be super easy. This is but right now nobody really uses it. Except me and then Don and Karen if they're doing change orders. Change on the requests.

Chi Ejimofor
Is it hard to add a new user on here?

Kendra Ash
No. No. I can add you right now if you want.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, if you can. Just f I'm I might I mean that'll be a weekend. I might just you know, I'm not I won't touch anything but just I'll go and Hope they have I like these people that have like their own little courses and stuff, but something else.

Kendra Ash
Um I just changed Don and Karen's um Stuff. I don't know compliance.

Chi Ejimofor
So right now this is like this is a subset of our projects, the ones that have specifically needed changeovers or change orders.

Kendra Ash
Change orders. Yeah. Yeah. And then all the ones we manually do billing for. We do okay, notifications, email, count settings. Did this. Oh, what if I go into an account? Can I add you in my settings up here.

Chi Ejimofor
Project team maybe. Sounds like that's where I'm Yeah, that's where you're headed. Okay. Oh there it is. There's something. Yeah, nice.

Kendra Ash
Okay, can I just add someone? So this is just this isn't where I can okay, where can I add I can just was in there I found it and updated their 'cause I I found I realized they didn't have access to see a lot of stuff so I had to go in and I make them managers so we could all see everything, you know, because it's not very helpful if you can't see everything.

Chi Ejimofor
Right.

Kendra Ash
Um God dang it. Has to be in compliance. I mean I just did it.

Chi Ejimofor
Well go back to company settings? Okay.

Kendra Ash
Company settings. Team.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Invite team member.

Chi Ejimofor
There you go.

Kendra Ash
What's your how do you spell your last name?

Chi Ejimofor
EJI M-O F as in Frank O R. Oh Fox Child. I'm trying to learn that little alphabet thing
Kendra Ash
But Oh yeah, I know. I'm not very good at it. Okay, I invited you.

Chi Ejimofor
Fun. That'll be fun. So uh Okay. Okay. All right, let's let's um contract. All right. Do I have it open?

Kendra Ash
We usually don't get contacts from Feckwriter. That's kind of interesting. I didn't even realize it was from them. Okay, so I I this is the first time we've ever gotten a contract from them. We usually just they send us signed estimates. So um apparently obviously all this stuff needs to be filled out, which that's pretty, you know, self-explanatory.

Chi Ejimofor
Project manager. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Just so you know, suppliers, we never have suppliers for jobs. Because Don't ever put a supplier in because we don't use a supplier specific for job. We use everything from yard stock. So we purchase it no matter what and then we just have it and use it. Because otherwise then you have to get pre- You have to get lean waivers from them on everything and it becomes a big mess. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Um and who are we are we putting you said it's self was who are we who do you put as the project like uh the project manager or whatever it is? Are you putting
Kendra Ash
So project manager, I usually put Jason.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Compliance contact. I guess I put Dawn because she would be doing the um yes she would be doing the in certain certs and stuff. Bill in contact. See with them oh it is Swift. So that would be me Um and then yes, this would be NAVO.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so project manager for us is the delivery kind of you put the deli well you put either Jason in general because it's usually SWPPP for contracts I guess. It's yes, yes. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Is that yeah and I should pull up the um estimate. That's what I need to do. Um, okay, so we need to go to Bequity and QuickBooks Find the estimate. So what is this job called? Forty-three oh one-seven eleven forty-three oh. See, that's one problem with how all of these are labeled. Like this one doesn't have anything. It just has 711 Well, we do they're all 7-Elevens. You kind of have to have an address or a job number or something to distinguish it from the other ones. But that's for temp fence. Oh, Jared a pul attached it. That's right. He attached it to the email. So no he didn't. Shit.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, that was a that is a um inst in the So you have to go and find certain which
Kendra Ash
I have to go find whatever wherever this is, which this is what Jared's supposed to do. He is supposed to match up the estimates, but that's just not been happening.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's like which estimate is for this contract is the thing.

Kendra Ash
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So first of all the best thing I usually I try and usually look up the price first. Okay, ten three four six. Do we have anything that matches ten three four six? No. No, we don't. Okay, so try and find an address that matches. Right here. This is it. 4301 Um okay. So and they're saying it's 10,346 and we have 11,421. So we have to figure out what they're not asking for. So then this is where you go through and look for the schedule of values. So it should be here. Oh, they just put right in our estimate. So that's kind of cool. So they want the narrative, they want the sock, they want the rock entrance Um, they want the inlet protection, erosion control blanket, swips, no Yeah SWPPP sign and spill kit oh no concrete washout they took that out so we'll zero that out SWPPP sign spill kit um And then they don't use GCPA and they don't have any, it's not CCP, so we won't charge them these fees. And they do want inspections and a mode. So we should match now. Let's. . . What was the total?

Chi Ejimofor

10 34 6 10 3 4 6 we match wait wait wait wait wait okay wait wait where uh let me just where's the let me put it up on two screen and this one is easy because they attached our estimate so it's
Kendra Ash

super easy to figure out. So that was very nice. Very nice. So yes, the estimator normally does this. and um then you save the changes um so that it will match. Do not add it asks if you want to add all these like addendums down at the bottom to explain what we changed. But we just zero them out so we know that we originally offered them, but they didn't want them instead of adding all this crap in the bottom. So we do not add. And then anyone can go back in here now and find that estimate and look it up. Well and we should take it and well this is what yes, so Jared usually does this, but um send out the estimate the contract to contracts with the estimate attached. So then everyone has it 'cause you know, like I said, a lot of people don't like to read the contracts 'cause it's just more work.

Chi Ejimofor
So ideally okay, so if we start to uh okay, let me see Oh yeah, so the the sum is here. So you uh zero it out, check it real quick. Um and then you're check do you you uh You're saying this is like the contract review and then you just right now it gets sent to the contract's email. Um
Kendra Ash
Is well that's where but you can kind of see right now that's all that's happening. Sure. Yes, is it's just getting matched up like that and getting sent out if that's happening. Um
Chi Ejimofor
Uh and you okay, so for you if we just if we did your part right now, I mean how like How long would it take? I mean you have to like read through I mean I think you're s you're kind of skipping past a lot of stuff.

Kendra Ash
The point is this one's really easy because of that except. So now you do have to kind of look through it, which I already know Vecquity these um You know, they're not gonna have any certified payroll. They're probably not gonna have any weird requirements because we're out on we have seven of these jobs we're doing with them right now. I don't even know why we're getting a contract on this one it's very strange but then you just look for any like weird um I don't read all the mumbo jumbo stuff which I've told Tim a billion times because I'm not a lawyer and I don't read contracts. So I just read um anything like, you know, requirement well, you know, if it's certified payroll or if there's badging we need to get or um that sort of thing. And then Since they put everything from our contract, which that's the schedule of values, that's really nice, except they do like you kind of just um go through here mobilization and demobilization. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is just all um standard stuff for all subs, which is perfect. So this is a really easy, nice contract. So that's it. That's what I would look at and I'm good with it. Here's scope of work. I would just glance through this. Um, we'd be responsible for our own dust control if we needed it for our layout, you know, just normal stuff for every customer. Change orders are required for any additional work and then the insurance certs that are required. And yep, schedule what is this? Um Oh, what the contract must yeah the contract has all that and they put that all in themselves and so yeah nothing strange and it does match and they didn't add anything strange so this one's actually Awesome. Super simple. It's done. I have the so now I can. I can take it. Of course, like I said, this really isn't what I'm supposed to be doing.

Chi Ejimofor
So you would sign it At this point?

Kendra Ash
I will s I will sign it, yes. So I'm going to take this since it was never sent out to anyone with contracts and with the estimate attached. So I will do it just to get it done. So I'm signing doing the estimate, then I will send two contracts. And um send out to everybody. Now I have to go back in. sign everything and um so this is all that's being done right now.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
And then like everyone knows what they do. You know, they'll look at it and If there's inspections on it, the inspectors will add it. If there's signs on it, Karen will get on that. If there's, you know, Don will pull the insurance certs. It's just everyone right now kind of You know, but things just get missed. And the good thing about this one, there's no dust permits and there's no switch plans needed Because that's another thing where we're just falling behind and not getting things done.

Chi Ejimofor
Do we know if they have a sweep plan already?

Kendra Ash
They do, yes. The reason we know is because there is a broke there's a breakout of all the BNPs. If it if there wasn't, it would say um it wouldn't have SOC and inlet and all that stuff on it. It would just have a SWPPP reserve for a certain amount and then there'd be a price on the estimate for a SWPPP plan So if there's everything broken out and you have all the BMPs showing, then you know that there was a SWPPP plan already You know what I'm saying?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay.

Kendra Ash
And um what's the I do get contracts that don't have anything any DNPs and it is just a lump sum st with reserve.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so the BMP okay, w where let me just f okay, I see dust control. Okay.

Kendra Ash
So here is one the estimate. So you know the sock this I I want I'm trying to think of one that I have just a reserve on. I can't think of one at the moment. But if you have all your inlet protection, rock and drinks, sock and stuff showing on an estimate, you know you have the plan. If there is just who would I have on? I know I have a few right now that we're doing that we need the plans for. But Ooh, it's better estimating the problem.

Chi Ejimofor
We should still we should still like double check or or we should like not double check is another word. Uh we should Like uh there should we should check I don't know Monday we should check somewhere to see where the plan is or if we don't have it we should get it from them.

Kendra Ash
What that yes, that is supposed to be that that's what the estimator is supposed to do. That is the estimator's job. But so here's one.

Chi Ejimofor
Can you see um I guess he did the uh he did the estimate, so technically probably had something, but who knows what he had.

Kendra Ash
Right, right Um, so they did have a plan. So like this one right here that I have open, this one is a budgeting estimate. And it says budgeting estimate because we do not have a plan. So the top line is us asking if they want us to do the plan for them. And then if you see here, it's just a SWPPP. There's no sock, rock entrance, inlets. None of that's broken out because it's just a SWPPP reserve. And then Jared I don't I Jared or Jeff, I don't know how they um estimate it, but they look at the size of the job and they figure about how much They think the reserve what how much the BMPs would be on it and we put in a lump sum and hope it covers it Which it usually does. That's usually not an issue. But um it kind of depends once we get the contract, you know, once we look at what they're actually wanting us to include So this is one that does not have a plan and that we would have to if they sent us something this would then have to go you know you have to submit it to whoever that is I can't remember their name right now that does our plans Why can't I remember their name?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, we have a person for it, yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yes, we do. I but yeah. We just got them not too long ago, so haven't really dealt with them much. And that's when you submit that. But yes, so for this one we know we have it and this was a really easy nice simple contract and I'll sign it later because there's never and fill it out because that would just be a waste of time. Sure. But now if you can go to let's try this one from Melanie. Um so I already know they have to redo this because this is one of the I have two of them from Caliente right now. And the other one I already went over and reviewed and told them what needed to be changed. But this one I haven't and because see they have it written they have it written to IDG. So I sent it back and they're gonna redo it. But I figured we should try to look at it now because if we have revisions for them. when they redo the contract they could do it all at the same time. So let's actually review it because I never did.

Chi Ejimofor
Do we have a do we have a login or Do we have a DocuSign? Because if I no if I click it it says the link from your email has expired.

Kendra Ash
Well then you just have to request it. one but you can just look at mine right now because it if stu other pe it depends how many times it's opened and it's sent to a ton of people so then you just
Chi Ejimofor
So it only gets okay. So it only gets sent out like a few it has a limited amount of opens or something. So you opened it once and then okay.

Kendra Ash
So, okay, so we'll go to caliente, go back to estimates, and this is first of all I always just try and look at the 10,54750. Is there anything in here for that? No. So obviously it hasn't been matched up yet. So Kawanis Park, North Playground. So then you just oh Kawanas Park. North improvements. So it must be this. But of course, really this is the estimator's job and they did these cu they did the estimates so it would be easier for them to find. But you know, Jared just doesn't have time and I need to get him out so I can't I just have been taken care of it 'cause it's just easier. So we gotta figure out what they want compared to the estimate since it does not match because this is for thirteen. So you just look through the contract and find their here's their scope of work right here. So and they have it all listed out, so this is probably gonna be pretty simple also So stock rock entrance inspections hmm they don't have a narrative so let's narrow that out stock one rock entrance Um inlet protection I would guess? No. Okay, this is very strange. No concrete washout, which is totally normal for them not to get that's they don't include the concrete washouts that often. Um no signs. That's kind of weird. No spill kit. Okay, um they do want inspections, 21 of them, which we have, two modes, and then they want the dust control permit. Which um okay so that is not carried over and I hope that's the correct price because I don't know the acreage of the job But let's hope that was updated So oh and then they don't we must probably not do they use texture I do sometimes They must have taken out these fees, the texture and the um OSIP fees. So then we match. So this one worked out really easily too. 10,54750, 10,54750. So these ones are nice. But then you still have to go and read through if they have any Like Kelly NG's good. They already know what we want pretty much and how we have to list them out and you have to put the amount of inspections. You know, it and they did. They listed everything exactly how it is, didn't add anything extra, and we're good So you just kinda then screw yeah, these are really easy.

Chi Ejimofor
Do they have a schedule on this one or no?

Kendra Ash
That is the schedule right here.

Chi Ejimofor
Or the schedule of the project, because I saw the other one they have the full schedule on it.

Kendra Ash
No, so that's the other thing. They're all different So um of what they include. So this and this one might how many pages is it? We haven't gone through, but then you just go through, okay, it's got the insurance, um requirements which we are good on. Job site safety Okay, no big deal. Then they got the job information sheet. If you want to pull prelim preliminary notice.

Chi Ejimofor
What's that mean?

Kendra Ash
Um most companies in Arizona, when you pull when you do a contract, you automatically um do a pre-lean on every one of them. Every job every company I used to work for, you always pull a prelim the second you get a job because it covers you if they stop paying you you can put a lien on the project. But if you don't do it then obviously you can't put a lien on the project and but we don't do them. We do them only like if we're not getting paid or something, we'll add it real fast. And just throwing it but it only goes back like twenty days. Yeah. So so if you've been working on it for three three years and all of a sudden they just quit paying you the last six months then it still only goes back twenty days, but we've never had a problem with it. We've always been covered. But and then here we have you know do you have any suppliers? Nope, nope nope. And that'd be it. This is another simple, easy Sent contract.

Chi Ejimofor
And okay. And who who who who and were you the one that received this?

Kendra Ash
Yeah, it looks like yes.

Chi Ejimofor
So So somebody sent this to you. Yeah, okay.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
And it was a reminder. Um
Kendra Ash
Do you want to recruit a change now? Yes, I do. Well yes because they have to change it. I keep getting them because they have to change it from IDG to um desert services before we can do it. anything with it. Uh did you until they void it and redo the new one, I'll just keep getting reminders, which I should probably just decline it so I quit getting them because it's kinda Okay. Because I always look at it and like, oh did they re did they do it? And then you look and they didn't.

Chi Ejimofor
You've and you've contacted this lady or you've contacted this lady already about that or?

Kendra Ash
Oh yeah. Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
And you like on the phone?

Kendra Ash
Um, no. I do everything I do everything in writing. Email. I don't do I rarely ever do anything on the phone. So like here's another one we have. I'll show you this one that I did send them for updates. Um it's another caliente which we're waiting for them to redo And I probably won't go get in because oh no, it was a I am yeah yeah I must not have looked at this one yet today. Um because again it's just IDG so I sent them that it needs to be changed. But what Let's see what I had to send them to change. Valiente. Stephen Burr. Oh. Okay. Actually it was all f it wasn't that it was we were off five hundred dollars and I wanted to know why. And that's right, he had to update the contract. They were off on something that they they missed $250 and they wanted us to take off the $250 insurance fee. So if I look back so I emailed him and said I'm off this is all I because I had no idea. Said I'm trying to get the sign but I'm off five hundred dollars and I couldn't figure it out, you know from the estimate. Which I normally you know if you can't figure it out that's just what I do. I'll just send him and say, hey, please mark investment and um or let me know what I'm missing here And then he emails me back and just said. See, he says he voided it So why am I still getting it? Because I um Because here's where I told him hey Steven, can you please update our company info with the attached please? Let me know if you have any questions. And I wonder if you saw that part. Where did he respond to me though? Because he responded to me and said, hey, I'm gonna this is what was wrong and I'll get you a new contract Maybe he well yeah, maybe he didn't see the one where it because he didn't respond to my one about changing the name. Damn it. So I'm gonna email him that again and check with him and make sure he saw that. Because the one I'm getting still has IDT on it. So where was that that I sent that oh oh here's see this here's oh because Austin sent it to me the correct value we will resend is sixteen two six five we will not be adding the value for the CSIP insurance. So remove that and they'll add the other T50. Please please advise and I'll revise this contract this afternoon Okay, I'm gonna reply to all these people and let them know that we need it changed So that's kind of a bummer. So I'll just attach my old email where I already sent it and let him know that we need the IDG changed. And then that will be done. But yeah, so that's all I do when I'm like but you you need to see some that are wrong that we have to send back We have to get adjusted.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, so well.

Kendra Ash
And that'll be those came out real and usually I can't like a lot of times I can't figure out the estimate of why it doesn't match and what's wrong with it, but But um yeah those ones came out those ones were very simple and easy
Chi Ejimofor
That's good. Um okay, so uh and then as a question, back updated with IB with desert services, I can sign those
Kendra Ash

caliente ones because they're correct now and um then I can sign that other one and we're good on all three of them You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh and then just and then on kind of so right now people basically they don't they read the Uh they read the what was I gonna say? They read the estimate to see if they're on it real quick. Um A next level of that would be that they uh can see or they can wait a minute the next level of that would be like they get an email that's like hey You know, with a name beside it like this is what you're supposed to do.

Kendra Ash
Um and the next level above that would be when we just have Jeff, he would actually send out of course There was only five of us at the time. Who's Jeff? And when he you know, and when he'd send it out to someone to us, he'd send it out to all of us, he'd just put our emails in and we didn't have a contact.

Chi Ejimofor
And which one's Jeff? Who's Jeff?

Kendra Ash
Jeff Gardner. Oh if he doesn't work in the office. Does some estimating.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, he used to be our our estimator, but he's gonna be eighty-seven in two weeks.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes, yes, yes.

Kendra Ash
Um He would actually just send it out to who needed it, you know? Like if there were signs on it it would go to Karen. If there weren't it wouldn't go to Karen.

Chi Ejimofor
Are you aware of it?

Kendra Ash
Um, Jared just did it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Switched it over.

Kendra Ash
So yeah, there's just a lot of things that got changed in the processes that when it went from Jeff to Jared, not did not carry over to Jared Everdoing. So like a lot of that now I'm doing and it's so then it's on my plate which like matching up all the contracts with the estimates and making sure they you know and getting with the customer if they don't match and what the problem is and stuff, that's should really be the estimator. But that's just not been happening. So and I can't I'm sick of asking. So I've just been taking care of 'cause there's just way too much and they need 'em back right away, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. They gotta work
Kendra Ash
Uh so um but normally okay that part it would be the estimator, then he would send it out to all of us, you know, for um of who needed it is how it would happen. And then we all take care of what we needed to do. But and and make sure that we all have the same correct name. We know who the customer that we're actually billing is, that's been an issue coming to us. That there's like one person's on the estimate, one's person on the email, there's another name on the contract, there's who are we billing. Nobody knows and it goes it nothing should go out to everybody being such a mess because then everyone is scrambling to figure it out and it's wasting everyone's time, you know? So all that should be figured out before it's sent out.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Because then at least only one person is trying to figure it out, then fifteen people trying to figure it out. You know, and wasting the time doing it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, so for contract stuff you're mainly looking for, you know uh s so once it's matched up, you're looking for kind of
Kendra Ash
Anything that sticks out that's like all you know Yes, something different that isn't just a yeah, uh boilerplate. Yes Which we'll get some hopefully that we have some and and then the weird thing is almost every single one you have to send back to the customer because they don't put the amount of inspections in or they put in um maintenance and removal is included or they you know like everyone does that so you have just cross I guess just cross it off send it back to them And say, hey, you know, can you please adjust this? This is not included. You know, that'd be an additional cost and whatever. And they do, and they don't care, and everyone's always super nice and It's very yeah, as long as you can get them to get it updated and sent back, that's the problem. It usually takes a few times of bugging them. You know? 'Cause everyone is busy. So
Chi Ejimofor
Makes sense.

Kendra Ash
But when we get more in, next one I get in, I'll call you we'll schedule it again.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Very good. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for the time. Um That's good. It's good information. Um yeah, I'll play around with sightline a little bit, you know, take a look through that a little bit just as a PM and see if uh I think it's interesting for yeah, for like ongoing You know, especially for change like it it would be interesting for I don't know if they would do it in the field, but you know, hey, we have this change order and you just go in there and I don't know.

Kendra Ash
It would be what chang right they can see what changes are outstanding and actually you can send them t in between the teams that someone could approve it or not. I mean there's just none of that. None of that happened. I just take care of all of it now and it's just a it's a mess kind of, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
And we don't get anything done ahead of time. We don't get it it's you know It's just not ever been but like I said, we're growing and that's the problem. When there was five people in the office and we all sat and could hear each other, it made a huge difference. Yeah, versus all over the place, you know. So that's why we need to figure out something to keep everyone that needs to be in the loop and You know.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that makes sense because I even saw I mean yeah the first one it had uh you know it had like It had the date that they expected, of course it could change, but they had they already had the date, you know, that they wanted the SWPPP installed, you know, so it's like you know, that's like you you don't mean you can still call and just double check, but it's like you already have that, it's like You can kind of figure it into the flow without, you know. Right. Yes. Like this is the day, three weeks in advance. Can we, you know, can you get that done?

Kendra Ash
Yeah, and a lot of times that they do, but then there's yeah, there's lots of times that it's like, oh oh my god, we need you out here today or tomorrow or yesterday, you know? It's a big brush, but These ones are all pretty good.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash

look at them all and see what's different and yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. That sounds good. Sound good? Yeah. Okay. Alright, thank you. Talk to you later. Cheers. Okay. Bye-bye.
