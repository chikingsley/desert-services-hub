# Kendra Ash Transcript

Chi Ejimofor
Alright. Okay, okay. Uh I guess there's a general thing on Okay, so we have I what I'm understanding we have like we have invoiced work we have like we have contracts and we have invoices we have like kind of two yeah uh Is there stuff that typically I guess only sits like like for example SWIP installations, that's like always is there like anything that's like this like always contract basically? No. Okay. So anything in general can look at it.

Kendra Ash
Most of the time, like ninety five percent of the time, I'll roll off, I'll forward a job. that is usually all invoice. SWIP is probably more SWIP is more contract than not, you know? And then Water Truck and Sweeper are Probably twenty-five-thirty percent needs to be built to the contract and the rest is by invoice. Kinda that's kinda my guess.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
It really depends on the customer.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
Not even just the customer, it depends on which job and the project manager. So we can have um the same customer with different projects and different project managers. managers and they can all have different requirements.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, and when we say like contract versus invoice, that's like the way that it's um that's the way that it's billed. Does that mean that Well, I guess to a ask the question, whenever well, okay, when we find out that we won the job Is that the point where we understand whether we'll be charging yeah, I guess what pretty much, yes, once we get a contract.

Kendra Ash
then we know. Um and then so if it's by invoice then obviously all you have to do is put an invoice together and send it, which is really easy and we wish everything was by invoice. invoice but it's not it's by contract service by contract you um can only submit something once a month which now we do with everything anyway in case because a lot of the other services have to be put on the contract so that's how we do everything but so you can either do the invoice or like for the contract billing you can only submit it once a month and they give you the date So it's either by a um AIA, which we always did by hand, and so now we have the um platform sight line. that we can use for just manual AIAs that people require or they use one of their you know they either use Textura, GCPA, Procore, Premiere. I think those are the only four we use right now of outside um so then they give you like days so you have just this open window on whatever which ones there and they decide on that too they can be anywhere from like the tenth of the month to the twenty fifth of the month that they decide and you have to do what yeah whatever they want yeah
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh and I asked I asked a couple of people, but do we okay, do we um What percentage of the time, I guess, uh in the you know, if the world is perfect, are we getting contracts in advance? of work uh in general.

Kendra Ash
Maybe we don't have it like um In gener I I can't really not not in general. Not in general. 'Cause everybody like I'm sure We already know everybody needs us on site first before they can do anything else.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
So there are subcont some contractors because of course we're not supposed to be on site ever until we have a contract and they have the insurance in place. So some contractors certain contractors they will make sure they get them out to us but that's very that's very few. It's actually more along the lines of we're on site before we ever get a contract and know exactly how we're billing or what requirements they have.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you think the is it generally I guess it's hard to even know, but is it stuff that we've submitted s estimates for like most of the time or is it like kind of random as well?

Kendra Ash
Yes. Okay. Most of most of the time it's definitely submitted estimates for. For contract work. But we do have a lot of
Chi Ejimofor
So for s you said water jun, okay water turn water truck
Kendra Ash
Portage on roll offs, those are more I would like a lot more percentage of call-ins than estimates.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But the SWIP and Well even temp fence, little temp fence jobs are a lot of just call-ins, but big temp fence jobs they are usually definitely estimates and most SWIP all we have at mostly always
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh Okay. Okay, so then there's a magic question. Okay, so we okay. Um So for stuff we bid on, uh so it sounds like we're not we don't get a contract necessarily in advance. So what is the is it I'm hearing like it's a like a kind of a vibe of communication that you won or not. It's not like an exact thing. Or yeah, or yeah, I guess how does how is that like W in your view, like when we are kind of winning something or we won or what?

Kendra Ash
Like what gives you the indication to like start questioning or will either send us an email or a contract or call somebody. Which now it's much more confusing because we used to have five people in the office.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
Now we have many so it can go out to the people in the field. can go you know it can they can tell anybody.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So it is definitely something that needs to be tracked better now. Um just knowing that yes we are even getting the job to begin with, you know, because then it would be good if someone could follow up and after that and be that person or something. But Um right now, yeah, it's kind of just whoever is getting the notifications and they're kind of doing the follow-up and you know, and so yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and that's basically sales, any of the delivery managers, uh Jason or yourself or estimate These are like this is like does that cover everybody that could get a something?

Kendra Ash
Well, most mostly yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Um but every once in a while they can go to Don, they can go to Karen, they you know but and then of course what's Rick and Tanya do not not Tanya what am I Lacey and Brennan which now they are they do do sales so yes they should kind of um in Jared and Jason and I and Yeah, so okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and that's okay, they email, contact, or call.

Kendra Ash
Um yes, normally Email. Yeah and and if they do call, we tell everybody anyways, get it in an email and just forward it so everybody has it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Just so there's starting the line of communication on it, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. So if you get a contact, I guess theoretically if the estimate oh I guess that's it interesting uh if we sent in an estimate Uh that somebody I guess I see that I see that people do attach it to the QuickBooks somehow, sometimes so in general whoever gets the contact might or should tell Jared and then Jared would add the estimate that he already did to the QuickBooks. That's how it might go.

Kendra Ash
Well, I'm not sure on Jared's end.

Chi Ejimofor
Sure, sure. Okay.

Kendra Ash
in QuickBooks under estimates. Then when we get a contract, he normally attaches it and sends it out to the contract email to everyone on it And then um you I will go through it and check to see what isn't matching and what they're adding in into it that we have to get taken off and um and then I will will put usually because it's not already done so I put the job in the um and then I attach the contract and the estimate or just the estimate or the email um into QuickBooks. And now we are also having so there's if it's a contract, normally I'm putting it in QuickBooks against the job. But um and we're trying to do now since we are being audited now that we have a different sort of company and a different way we do our books, um everyone should be doing that with like just any email um or any PO or anything, throwing it into QuickBooks and attaching it just so we have something, some proof that it the work was requested because we will be needing that in the future.

Chi Ejimofor
So for every estimate that we that is submitted there should be like a project, even if we don't win, there should be a project created in QuickBooks with that estimate attached.

Kendra Ash
No no no no No, in QuickBooks there is just an estimating um section. So in QuickBooks it should just show um under each customer or Sometimes it's just underestimating department if it goes to a bunch of people and that's when it needs to be if it is underestimating department when Jared gets contacted that we got the job it needs to be moved to the customer And then the estimates under the customer, they have the name on them that shows up in the memo. So you can search them, you know, you can just find them by the name. in the memo and then they should always be matched up to the contract so that the anyone who goes into QuickBooks to grab the estimate knows exactly what's on the contract because they are the same, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So I'm working on it.

Kendra Ash
And they need the information of what's on it and so it's needs
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Um once we do receive it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So there I haven't been in QuickBooks yet I'm trying to get access, but it's so there's Yeah sometimes that's a frustrating thing to Yeah. I don't know. Yeah those guys are those guys are dragging their feet over there. So they're they're fast about some stuff. I was like give me access to the SharePoint literally within ten seconds I had access to the I was like, what in the world?

Kendra Ash
But then I say something about QuickBooks.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm not ten seconds, but it was like it was like five minutes or something.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, it was quick. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Versus like this QuickBooks. I'm like I'm having to I've called, you know, yeah, they're dragging the feet. I don't know what's going on.

Kendra Ash
Well and you know that's the thing. So like we have to um log in remotely to our computers. So all our computers our desktops are still down there. So because the only way for us to get into QuickBooks is to log in to get onto our desktop to get into QuickBooks. So I can use SharePoint and I can use um I can get onto my email outside of that but you can't get onto QuickBooks without getting onto my um desktop which goes down all the time like even this morning I couldn't get on until um which I mean I usually just start a lot earlier, but you know Eva got in at seven, which wasn't bad, and she restarted my computer for me. But I have to have that happen all the time because I can't work without QuickBooks But they can't get it to work outside of logging in and having a desktop down at the office, which I don't so I'm sure that's probably the the problem with them getting you all on it, you know.

Dawn Wagner
Oh, you don't have her up no more on camera?

Chi Ejimofor
No, what the hell?

Dawn Wagner
I wanted to show you something. Oh, we couldn't get it to work. Oh then get it dang it I wanted to show you my white shirt oh send me a picture uh it's my stuff James before We like to get the same thing. He's laughing. He's like, oh my. Look at his face. I'm chillin'.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm in here. Um, what was I saying?

Dawn Wagner
He's like on that note.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you guys actually like screen you guys are like s remote um you guys are like remoting into the the computer. Okay, that's so that's what they're saying. I didn't understand they're saying something about screen connect or something and I was like
Kendra Ash
Uh I don't know QuickBooks is totally separate. You have to be able to get onto the whatever the server at the office to be able to get into QuickBooks.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, they're the other ones you can just do online, so I'm not sure on that why that is, but
Chi Ejimofor
Uh Yeah, okay. Well we'll figure that out. But okay, so there is a an estimating section And then there so there's two estimating sections. There's an estimating section under in general and then there's an estimating section underneath each customer. Is that what I understand? Yeah, if you can.

Kendra Ash
Um Quick book stuff of that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, we can if we get back on team.

Kendra Ash
Calling me? Or am I calling you?

Chi Ejimofor
Yes, you're calling me. I opened something. Yes.

Kendra Ash
I don't know how much I'm not a computer person, so let me share my screen. Oh, because of a remote con session. You're seeing. I just got kicked out because my remote session didn't like that logging. very temperamental and thinks I'm looking at bad things on the internet apparently. So hold on, let me log back let me get back in. I got kicked out.

Chi Ejimofor
So they set up this thing because of the situation that happened.

Kendra Ash
Yes, when we got hacked.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
A long time ago. Well, actually it wasn't that long ago. Okay, here we are. Now share. Stop. How come it's not working? Shares. Oh, I have to hit shares. Ooh, okay. Okay. Let me get rid of this because I have a big screen so it I know it's not very easy to see. But here's my QuickBooks
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, let me make this does it help if I make it enormous, I'm wondering, or like just harder for me to see just because it's Whichever way is easier for you. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But can you see it?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I can see it.

Kendra Ash
Okay. So like right now I'm in customers.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes.

Kendra Ash
And um so if I go into estimates on the customers, like this is someone we don't have any with. Let's just go to Mill Creek. Yeah. So here's all of the estimates. And if you right here's the memo where it'll tell that well it should tell if it's labeled right. But that's the other problem with just labeling things. We they get so many different names. But um here's the job names. So when we get a contract, Jared would be going in and going into the estimate.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh this is where the match the contract. Yeah yeah, this is where the estimates thing is occurring in general.

Kendra Ash
Where he estimates it and then does the PDF.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah he is, he is, he is. Yeah. I didn't I didn't connect the dots in my head. Okay. Okay, so cool. So and the estimates is so For every single person, even if it's a new person, like he'll add a entry or something, but every single it's under a it's under a a listing, you know.

Kendra Ash
Okay. And then we do have just estimates because a lot of times you know you'll get one and it goes to a group of people because no one's won it yet. And we just do those under estimating departments.

Chi Ejimofor
And you only create you only want to create like a uh a customer if we win at any point Is that uh No no no.

Kendra Ash
I mean you put it under a customer if the specific customer already has the job, but a lot of times you'll get an estimate and it no one will have won it yet. So it'll have to go to fifteen different people So that's when it just goes under estimating department. And then once we find out who won it, then we move it under the customer.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. So that way Okay. Hmm, is there any re okay. I guess are we is it um yeah I guess what is why is that and s why is that instead of just entering it under Well a customer every time.

Kendra Ash
Oh, because we don't know who the customer is. Nobody's won it. Cause like say the city of Scottsdale throws out an estimate for us. So it's un so there's just it doesn't go to anyone yet. It has to go to well it has to go to many customers. Like they'll be they'll have a bidder's list of who's who's gonna be the general on you know bidding on it so they can have a list of 20 um general contractors that will be bidding on it so we have to send the estimate to all of those customers
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. I see.

Kendra Ash
So that's why it's not under a specific customer, because we don't know Yeah, we just it's just what does it say? It just has like swift budgeting estimate and it has no customer, it just has estimating departments and you know, that's it until we get a customer and then we update it once we do.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, okay. Um Okay. Where's my little thing here? Okay. Okay. It goes under the estimate section or it could be uh under the customer.

Kendra Ash
Or under a customer, yes, depending on who's asking for the estimate
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, and then if we get some communication, then it moves from then you you have to add a line item of the job number or the job name, I guess, and then well actually it doesn't go
Kendra Ash
The the estimate just goes under the customer.

Chi Ejimofor
We don't actually put it on the job.

Kendra Ash
Once we get a contract, an email, something like that. Then um well actually when we get the job you should still put the job in right away, yes, but um the main estimate doesn't go on the job itself, it goes on the customer Which I'm not sure why. That's just how we've done it. Is that the best way? I don't know. Not really sometimes. Because when you have um a bunch estimates on one project on one customer. Sometimes again we have lots of jobs with them. It's can be so maybe it should go on the job. I don't know. I just never did it that way before.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I've heard a couple things 'cause I I know Jason um because of the way that uh my understanding is the Because of the way that uh because in general seems like we don't get the contract before you have to do work, he will sound like he pref when I talked to him yesterday a few days, sounds like he prefers that the estimate be in the in that folder so he can do some of the I don't know. So it helps him with his when he when he calls and stuff.

Kendra Ash
But I don't Well either way, I don't think you would care if it was on the job or on the customer. Okay, so we just as long it's just as long as it's in there and it matches what they want. We have to know that's the thing, we have to know what they want.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
If we have the As if we have the contract or not, because otherwise Jason has no idea what they're scheduling and normally the superintendent on site doesn't really know either. you know what was actually awarded to us.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. Interesting. Um and then scroll up. Okay, so it's only after so whatever the so if Jason gets something And and confirms or or if you finish the contract that's what gets that's when the lung j job number the job thing gets created. Something like that.

Kendra Ash
Kind of. Well actually it should be just when um Jared gets the estimate in the contract. That is right away that should be put in the job names should be put under the customer and the estimate should be made sure that it is under the customer not underestimating and it should be matched up so the job the dollar amount matches And that everything on it matches.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so when Jared get in Jared in general, Jared's the one who's getting If anybody's getting a contract, he's the same.

Kendra Ash
Yes, normally since he sends out the estimates, he would be the one to mainly get them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. How does uh you know how do these like ran you know call ins and all this, you know, I have like How did all these other things figure in with uh like this QuickBooks stuff? You know, if somebody calls, I guess, um I don't know, randomly they they want temp fence or something.

Kendra Ash
Like how does that Right. Um what we ask them equal, we have to have the address or a job name. And um yeah it kind of depends if who's like sometimes Jason will add it in right away if it's something new and we haven't, you know, we don't have anything on it or um I will kinda it kind of depends. But yeah, so if it's temp fence, if anyone gets an email on Temp Fence to get you installed. Um and they don't, you know, they already have an estimate or they don't want to send in a contract or anything. It just we automatically send it to Jason And Jason gets down the schedule. If it's for a roll-off, you just send it to Wendy. If it's for um Portajohn, well now you send it to Steven Um or you know, so it's just an email usually or a phone call. A lot of times, so that's the other thing. Kelly gets tons of phone calls Wendy gets tons of phone calls and those kind of things we don't ever have email confirmations on there because they don't really do that. They just they actually we don't we do everything in email. Like if Jason gets a call for anything he says okay I need a s an email confirmation but so we don't always have them on street scooping roll offs portageons Sometimes water truck.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's a little bit obviously dangerous because Yes, right, exactly.

Kendra Ash
Which that is something we're trying to that shouldn't be happening. We should have it. Something I don't just something something you know just give me an email is fine just something that says because yeah for the audit purposes and that can be a problem. Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay. So when so that's Wendy and Cali are fifty those those are the wait, um That's roll-offs.

Kendra Ash
Those are the people that most of the time we don't get because I don't even think like that because they don't work in the office, they really not I they never have.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
And they don't you know what I mean? It's just it's a different system for them. So and it's just never been Yeah, we've been saying it far without everyone needs um to send everything in emails, but they've never done it and it's just not been a thing that was required and You know, I don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean the uh well I guess in general, I mean what uh does it it's a risk, but I guess even um how often has it. ton of problems with it.

Kendra Ash
It's just but it's more now we need them because of audits. Don't care. They still want proof You know, it it doesn't make any sense. I'm like 'cause I didn't realize that. I'm like, well it's already paid for, what do you care? Obviously, you know, and they're like, No, we still need what so that's where all of this has been coming in more where we need somehow to make sure we're getting everything in writing.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, for something, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, so I sh let me see this, okay. Okay. Uh so generally um just like going through and confirming s uh we get we get a contract, uh let's say Uh I'll have to revise that, but let's say estimating generally gets the contract in this contract situation. Estimating gets the contract. He'll just send it to the contract's email.

Kendra Ash
So yes, well he's supposed to match it up.

Chi Ejimofor
He's supposed to match it up in advance. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Um yes, and make sure everything matches. And then send the contract with the estimate out to the contract's email. If it if it's that's another thing that's just been become a kind of a mess.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Because we used to like Jeff Gardner used to just send it to who needed it. Yeah You know, so like if there weren't inspections on it, it wouldn't go to the inspectors. If there weren't signs on it, it wouldn't go to Karen for signs. You know, that sort of thing. 'Cause now it just goes to everybody and if someone doesn't feel like reading the entire contract and looking through for the schedule values, especially if there's not an estimate attached, but and sometimes there is, but the description isn't um matching was on the contract depending on if there are monthly inspections, weekly inspections, whatever, then People don't know and we are doing the wrong thing. So that's one of the other reasons that someone doing the contract part And sending it out to you know, that would just be helpful to have something like that again. There's just no time. There's just no one with timer.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If it doesn't match He's the one who should be fixed Well that's what that's what Jeff Gardner used to do. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Well I used to we used to do it together kind of like if he had an issue I would help him but Yes. Jeff Gardner used to take care of that. Um, but now I pretty much do.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so there's two things. So it's like Eee so Jared generally is supposed to check check if it matches, but you also do as well, is that what I mean?

Kendra Ash
And just doesn't, you know, none of the description.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, checks so he checks it.

Kendra Ash
But then there's a bunch of other things that they have written in it that don't match and we can't have that have to be changed in the contract.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he checks if the dollar amount matches and tries to match it up. If there's a I guess I'll ask him, if there's an issue he'll send it back to them and correct it.

Kendra Ash
Well I mean that was how it used to work, but and it's everyone's when he first he wasn't kinda doing it, but normally I just take care of it now because Okay, so I have I'm the one who has to sign the contracts
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so if it if it so he'll he'll do his best to match it up, maybe.

Kendra Ash
Uh and if it does done yes, the dollar amount stuff, yes he does.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay
Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
And then if it does, he'll send it to the general mail. If it doesn't, he'll still send it to the general email and give you a note or something?

Kendra Ash
Or um I don't know. No, no, no, no. Normally if it Well, sometimes he'll just send it to me and Jason if it doesn't match. Or sometimes he'll talk contact the customer. Like there's not really a any and all. It's like it's it's not all the time.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Or yeah, sometimes I'll just get the estimate that it just doesn't match.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, somet okay. And then will he send it to the the the contract's email?

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
In gener like i in it might uh he will do it all the time, yes.

Kendra Ash
Yes he just sends it out to everyone on the contract's email.

Chi Ejimofor
Even so e but it's you it this is this is if the dollar amount the dollar amount should be matching by the time it hits that email. Or yes or no? Yes generally should be.

Kendra Ash
Okay But actually everything on the contract should be matching by get by the time it goes out to the contract's email. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. But current state doesn't probably
Kendra Ash
Um, no.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And so that's when everybody generally looks through um So I mean they're supposed to, but let's say I was I had basically operations. Operation C that's another thing.

Kendra Ash
That's another thing where um if someone would go through it, um, you know, a contract person and um find out what they are naming it Because the estimate a lot of times is named something different because that was what was on the plan.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
And then when they send out a contract or even in their email, they name it something completely different Yeah. And then people look at just the estimate, they don't look at the contract and they name it that and then s other people and no one has any idea what anyone's talking about because they're all different.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
And we don't even know they're the same job
Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So that's another one of the like it's just little dumb things like that that you don't think would be big a big problem, but they become a big problem. Yeah You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Generally sends it okay, so they sh so okay he sends it so he sends the estimate and the contract. And they people look through the they don't look through the contract, they look through the attached estimate to see.

Kendra Ash
I mean I have to c I have to to sign the contracts and I hate reading them so
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
I don't know why.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So they so they look through the attach operations people look through the attached that's gonna see if they're involved, and then you know, I'm calling you and then you you look through to Then do the final check and sign off on it.

Kendra Ash
Yes, and send it normally I have to send it back to the customer to have it um have things changed pretty much all the time.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
That's one of the more um time consuming things Just because it's kind of like when I have to get change orders. Customers don't answer very often.

Chi Ejimofor
They're not the most responsive.

Kendra Ash
So Unless of course they want the job started immediately. But if if the con if we already installed and then we get the contract and I need to get changes on it Then it's really difficult to get because they don't really care.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yeah?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Uh okay Okay. Um and then so the people okay, so then there's like a little bat there's like a circle thing around You going back and forth between the thing with between the people to get it finalized. Uh right.

Kendra Ash
And and then, yes, and then that's when everything, you know, there's it goes up to, you know, obviously for sign well then we have to request signs, you know, NOIs and dust permits and um the contacts for to be on those things and so that is always because that's kind of in between Karen, Jason and I So um all needing to know all that information. I mean I don't need to know much of it, I just need to know that they're done and like they're getting work done and Um well and it's depending on if we are pulling the dust permit or if they already have one or you know and then getting NOIs or pulling NDCs and that's kind of a all big mixture of people. At the moment. And I don't know if you can change that, to be honest, but uh what is the NDC?

Chi Ejimofor
First time I'm hearing that acronym.

Kendra Ash
NDC It's um a lot of people will pull an NDC in place of an NOI just because there's a certain question on ADEQ when you're filling it out and it says do you have runoff on your site? And they say no, because they don't. But it means do you when it rains would you know would you so but they get an N N D C instead of the NOI, we won't be able to get the information to do the narrative and the switch sign which they need, but then they can't get it. So that's just another part where our customers are always very confused. And a lot of times they'll stick with the NBC and just wait to see if they get um in trouble for it. And then if they get in trouble for it, then they pull the NOI and just make us, you know, do good narrative and sign real quick
Chi Ejimofor
Oh, no discharge. This is what it's called. No discharge permit.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, sorry. I just told you that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, all good.

Kendra Ash
But yes. Um, but say yeah, so you either get an NOI from ADQ or an N D C Yep, from the ADQ ADQ.

Chi Ejimofor
What's the Q? Uh oh look at these guys. Oh, environmental quayou. Okay. Yeah. A DQ I'm the favorite Okay. Okay, but so you should be like trying to finalize uh you sh you you all let's say you do the finalizing of the p of the contract though in general uh all of this stuff signs, dust permits, all this stuff like tr theoretically like charge like goes off whenever the contract is sent to the contract email.

Kendra Ash
Correct. Yes. So everyone should just be looking at what they have to do and getting it taken care of, you know? Which is the inspectors, the um if for insurance certs for signs for um uh obviously installs for plans for permits Everyone just has to have be accountable for their own stuff. You pull it you open it up and find out what you need and get working on it.

Chi Ejimofor
What is this insurance? I've not heard to uh I've not heard of this before.

Kendra Ash
Yeah. Well every job you have to be on, you have to have specific well, most jobs. Some d some of them we can do an any and all cert for a customer and they're fine with it if they just do little jobs, but anyone we have a contract with they need a cert um work comp general liability auto all of that um which those all go to don um and eva is helping out with those know too and um we those have to be those are very important. Oh or it's C SIP or OSIP which I'm still doing that paperwork but um It's just all insurance crap and you've gotta get it done before you get on site.

Chi Ejimofor
C oh should mention this. C S I P can use what are these acronyms
Kendra Ash
Yes, it is certified controlled insurance program or owner insurance pro wait, I should own owner certified insurance program. So those are just it's because so those A lot of companies now are requiring those, kind of like all the companies now requiring all the safety stuff that they didn't used to require. But so um these are required because customers can't trust their subs to keep insurance. So um owners, it's not even the um contractor, it is whoever's owning the job requires us to be a part of their insurance.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
So even if we have our own insurance, we're paying double because well a lot of them will pay for it, some of them will, but a lot of them deduct money from our contracts due to the C SIP and OSIP that we have to be a part of.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
And we have to just you do you fill out the paperwork, get them those certs, and then monthly you have to go in and do hourly um reports of just how many hours we are out on site every month for every one of the jobs.

Chi Ejimofor
Who does and that's Don or Eva does this And who does who does these like monthly fill out of insurance?

Dawn Wagner
Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
I do Uh how do you tr uh do you have like some sort of thing that you're using to track what you have to go fill out?

Kendra Ash
Yeah, I get emails. notifications when they're late. And that's when I get them in
Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay and that's the dumb thing.

Kendra Ash
The dumb thing is like do you know how often we do like because we work on site right away in the beginning and then we might not actually work on site because it's not for inspections because it's not work. you know so we might not work on site again for two years when it closes we'll just be doing inspections but you still have to go in there every month and just put Zero. So you know, I wish you could just do all of those at one time, but you can't.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's through some sort is it's the same kind of website or is like everybody has their own Well yeah, it's just it's just a w websites, but they're all different.

Kendra Ash
There's a bunch of 'em.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Oh, but our new insurance company we're starting a new insurance company on November first who actually does C SIP stuff themselves and C SIB and OSIP stuff themselves. So we're Don and I are really, really hoping that once that happens um they'll be able to help us out with those a lot more and maybe it'll make it easier. Maybe not, but we're hoping.

Chi Ejimofor
Um is that Okay, so we're moving in the moving at the end of the month have is that a are you in charge of the you know communication with them or No.

Kendra Ash
No No. We'll get the update that well Don m mainly will update all their circ but they shouldn't be s I don't know ask you can ask ask Miss Don if who's I think it's Natalie might be handling a lot of that.

Dawn Wagner
What's that?

Kendra Ash
for the um new insurance program and new insurance company we're moving to.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, um she said we should have s soon. Um I asked her about it last week and they're still currently working on it.

Kendra Ash
Yes, the twenty-seventh.

Dawn Wagner
Oh, we're gonna get it the twenty-seventh?

Kendra Ash
No, it is the twenty-seventh today
Dawn Wagner
Oh yeah yeah. Okay. I'll ask her.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, people are gonna start freaking out.

Dawn Wagner
They already are freaking out.

Kendra Ash
Oh I know, I'm getting a hundred emails a day.

Dawn Wagner
Uh-huh.

Kendra Ash
And but yeah.

Dawn Wagner
Lovely texture.

Kendra Ash
Huh?

Dawn Wagner
I said that lovely textura.

Kendra Ash
Yes, that one's fun.

Dawn Wagner
Other shit. Other stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Sorry So I'll ask her. So I have to you'd have to ask that lady, so part of the is it like we're ask part of it we're double checking or trying to see if they'll handle the C.

Kendra Ash
They have to send out updated shirts to all of our customers by eleven one. Which 'cause otherwise we get kicked off of all of our sites. Yeah, they start threatening and they won't pay us and they just like they've been emailing us for over a month now constant non-stop all of our customers that we're already we should we're deling quint already which we're not but they just start sending out warnings yeah okay
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so hopefully somebody's handling that. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yes, Natalie should be taking care of that. Oh, I like the green.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. It's mine. Um so if that if that actually becomes the case, does that mean that that part of the process is like we still have to send those out at the beginning or is that like We just have to contact that company.

Kendra Ash
So like right now, even with the con with the insurance companies we have, once we get the contract Um Donner Eva will take the information off of the contract and um send it to WorkComp. and then also to our GL company with all the correct information that the customer needs. And then they send them back to us and then we have to get them back out to the customer. And at Don has been taking care of that film. And now she has Eva helping her 'cause there's a lot. Especially when we up when we change and we we just renew it down. Never. Never is a big mess.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So Okay, so that's something else. Okay. Uh but then Yeah, the NOIs should be done by those guys, right?

Kendra Ash
And then the customers have to do the NOIs, correct.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh And I guess at the very beginning in that case, like I guess Jason or Or somebody or who somebody's cont is somebody contacting them to ask for that information or For the NOI information. For the like the customers.

Kendra Ash
Oh yeah, we'll s we'll send an email. Either um So normally who asks is usually Jason or Karen just because they're the ones who need it for the signs. Um sometimes I ask for it depending on, you know, what I'm doing at the time. And um Yes, but right when we get the contract input, right when we get the contract, that should be one of the first things being asked immediately, you know Because whatever they have on it. If they have a dust sign, where's the dust permit? If they have a nar a switch sign and a narrative, where's the NOI? So that's just stuff we should be getting immediately.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then 'cause that's whatever's on cause the contra okay, and that's uh whatever's on the contract I guess even Some stuff's not like that stuff's not gonna change, I guess. Like if they need a narrative uh if they need a narrative, a plan or signs or permit desk permit permits none of that stuff's gonna change so technically if you see it you know you get to you get to asking or get to work type.

Kendra Ash
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah
Kendra Ash
The only problem with the plans, which I don't know what to tell you about this because I don't do anything with plans, but we get customers a lot that don't know they have a plan So we just have a budgeting estimate for them and then um when we are gonna go get the plan done well when Mikey's to go do them she'd find it and we'd be like they already have a plan. And then every once in a while too they'll be on the contract and I'll say, hey, how come we haven't done this plan? And then Jason or Jared will tell me that they found one So sometimes plans can be odd. The rest of it no, but plans. I like it. 'Cause I don't know why they don't know they have them and then all of a sudden find them. That you could talk to Jared about 'cause I don't know. Or Jason because I don't understand how they don't know. But Anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I mean they have to pay for that I think so.

Kendra Ash
I mean in their contract We could just do it and pay us for it regardless.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that's all that side in general. Um Uh uh G G L, okay. Well, and you okay, you're used to Jason's Excel sheets.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
I would say probably my worst one. Yes, I'm used to all the Excel sheets. That's all we've done since I've been here.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So whatever uh let me let me open that up actually. Let me open this up. Okay. Okay, okay. Confirmed schedule. Okay. sixteen if you leave backyard. Okay. So you will Whenever you you go into this you're looking for a cell that's highlighted green. Or do you if
Kendra Ash
Are you just looking for yeah, what are you Okay, when I'm billing I go to the confirms schedule and I'm looking for everything which I was just doing my monthly stuff so there's a ton in here right now so yeah so all the stuff that doesn't have green on it or pink um is all work completed that I need to get filled. So if there's if there's work in K, if there's stuff listed in K, then that means the work has been completed. If it's yellow, it usually means there's still questions on it. But there's probably a lot more questions. I just haven't gone through any of this yet because I haven't had time because I was doing monthly billing.

Chi Ejimofor
Um
Kendra Ash
Yes. So I'll go in here and all I do is I read what's in the work completed and put it on an invoice and if there's no questions then I moved it over build and verified and then depending on what I have to do with the invoice it might sit there all month long waiting until the billing opens up and I just add to it all month or if it's not a contract then it just gets sent out at that time if we're not doing more work.

Chi Ejimofor
Or
Kendra Ash
And won't do my last name only at four letters in it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. And you will what you will you'll take it and remove the green if it needs to be No no no no.

Kendra Ash
He removes the green once he puts the work completed. So are you looking on my screen?

Chi Ejimofor
Uh no I'm not.

Kendra Ash
That's when it needs to be billed by me.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, how do I get back here? Okay, I'm back. Okay. Alright, I'm looking at the screen.

Kendra Ash
So down at the bottom, this stuff in pink Um this has not been done yet.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Then when it's marked green, it's because Jason knows it has been completed and that it is done, but it's still waiting waiting for the work. completed and then once the work is completed that's all of this stuff. So all of these have their work completed and the work description is right here in K with all of the work completed. And then once it's billed, see like this one he still doesn't have a work done, but um just hasn't received that information yet. And then that is when I know I can fill it. Is when there are no colors in it
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, and you just look at that little that last thing and you're Do you do are you opening up any estimate or do are you just basically looking at all the time.

Kendra Ash
Yeah. All the time. 'Cause I have to do the um Well I have to do the schedule values for all the contract work. So I have to put the scheduled values together and then I have to match them up with the scheduled values and then I have to so most of the time we put in more than we're supposed to. So then I have to go back to the customer then and get a change order for the difference Or I see we did something that wasn't in the contract ever to begin with. Or there's things that were in the contract that were missing that we didn't do. So then I have to find out all of those things. Or if we haven't waited and then also inspections. I should check to make sure an inspector has it on their list that those inspections have started. And you know, and then if there weren't signs then why not? Where are they? Why didn't we deliver a spill kit? Why did we do a rock entrance when there was never one on the contract? And you know, just stuff like that
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um, okay.

Kendra Ash
So usually I go into so yeah that's what I have to look at the estimates over hundreds of times during a job. And for pricing too, because we do different pricing on things You know, so like stock might be 245 for one job, but it's two seventy-five for one. Mobes are all different. Um yeah, there's a lot of different pricing for everything. So I have to look at con at estimates and contracts. all the time, over and over and over and over.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh these days how often do we have like let's say like multiple lines of service on a on a project?

Kendra Ash
It's like most of the time or is it all the yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Most of the time.

Chi Ejimofor
Um mm-mm Man, I'm living in a my magical world right now, I'll tell you what I'm thinking. My what I'm thinking is these the site service managers have to be like project managers and have to should be like the top level of each of their little sites. That's what my braid is right now because it's wild that uh there's no like somebody controlling you know the top level you know like change order like you know I mean just like that is yes that is normally how it works so everyone who ever talks to me Yeah.

Kendra Ash
It's like, well, so how come 'cause I'm the only one, I mean pretty much well, every once in a while if Don or Karen have, you know, their work on a change order and I asked, you know, they'll follow up on it and try and get it but yeah if there's anything different or wrong I'm the one who must take care of all of it and I'm the one who has to get the customers to respond and get me change orders and get things changed and I don't really h have time to follow up. So I only ask them like once a month when I go to bill and I'm like, oh, they never sent me anything. So then I have to email them or call them. And then they might just ignore me for another four months. So we might have tight in shorter and they're sitting there for and that happens all the time It's very, very often, but it's like, you know, even the software we were looking at, they're like, well then your project managers have to get in here and like approve change order requests and do this and do that. I'm like, yeah, no, we don't have any of that
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah.

Kendra Ash
Don't have any of those processes.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes. So well it's it's it's started. Um that's I know. That's my as my but my first reaction is like this There's like sales, I think I believe in sales like Mike Hammond's but then I'm also like whatever the site services people are these are like well and you have to realize we never had site services people we just got them So Yeah, okay.

Kendra Ash
That's just yeah my general thought has definite room to grow for sure and to yes get so much better.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yes, yes, yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um okay, so no gre okay. Nice, so and then you s okay, so you send out the you'll send so based on Uh yeah, so whenever you see the everything is good, let's say no colors, you'll get the schedule values for stuff that's uh on contract, compare it. Maybe submit a change order or discuss uh something if there's no contract, then you just send the invoice And uh and you have some sort of is it like I don't know, it's in quick boy, is there like a thing where you just it's like you can see outstanding stuff?

Kendra Ash
Like No, no. Because we have retention, so we cannot print um receivables Because it's like a hundred pages long because of all the ret outstanding retention we have on projects.

Chi Ejimofor
What's uh what does that mean, outstanding retention?

Kendra Ash
Um, okay, so anytime we have a contract, the contract work they always hold 10%. So if we're doing the work for three years, five years, um We cannot done the install, you know. Say we did this install three years ago, so we still have like five thousand dollars of retention on it. And then they will hold retention on every single one of our um inspection and anything we send will hold ten percent. And it'll just be backlogging in QuickBooks for all of those years. So we have you can't print a receivables report because we have thousands and thousands of outstanding invoices because they look like they're past due, but really it's just retention. It's not past due.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean, obvious the question is, I mean, is there any way to differentiate between those two things inside of QuickBooks or okay. Nope.

Kendra Ash
I wouldn't talk to QuickBooks just is not really made for this kind of company. It's made for smaller, you know, companies. But we've just QuickBooks is made for small What are the bigger people?

Chi Ejimofor
W well maybe you're aware, I don't know if you're a w what are the what are the bigger guys using just in general? I mean Or the big names.

Kendra Ash
Um that I do not know.

Chi Ejimofor
'Cause I don't know any subcontractor.

Kendra Ash
I've talked to our contractors. Yeah And asked them before, but they use contract stuff. And because we don't use subcontractors.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know any subcontractors.

Kendra Ash
So I don't actually have that information.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. Uh so if we a at all like kept track of it it would have to be uh externally, possibly.

Kendra Ash
Yes, which Mr. Don could possibly figure it out, like he could do some kind of support.

Chi Ejimofor
Mr. Don. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay.

Kendra Ash
I always call them Mr. and Miss, but now I have to have another one because we have a new Don actually. I bet you cause he's really good at that kind of stuff. He could probably pull it out and figure out just ways to like kind of track it I guess. But it would all be manual through Excel spreadsheets where he'd have to put in just, you know, ways of Breaking it out. There's nothing with QuickBooks that can do anything like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I don't I don't know how quick bo I don't know anything I don't know enough about QuickBooks to like to say anything. Like can you like I don't know when you when you put in uh an invoice name or something, does it like Is there uh you know, you change the n I don't know, you you name it, do you name it a certain thing or something?

Kendra Ash
We well we do.

Chi Ejimofor
We do And so it depends.

Kendra Ash
Like all sweep invoices start with a SW. All sweeper invoices and waste sweeper and water trucks invoices start with an A. Portagon start with PJ. Um Roloff invoices now have weird have just numbers because they come out of crow.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And um And is everything build separate 90% of or 100% of the time I guess?

Kendra Ash
Not a hundred percent of the time, no. But a lot of stuff is separate.

Dawn Wagner
Which it's way easier when it's separate.

Kendra Ash
It's just that if it's contract it can't be, which went then it gets all messed up and yeah. It's that's the other thing about QuickBooks. It's really hard to track because You can't really adjust anything in there. So the only thing we have are the invoice numbers and then we have whatever in the memo. So we'll put in the memo when it was submit, what is going on with it, but then now because of how our accounting works, those have to be locked. So we've never had those locked So that's how Karen Don and I always just um communicated with all of our billing. And it was very helpful. But now that we have to lock the systems, once they get locked, you can't even update other memo. So now we don't know what's been built where when.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah I guess I mean it just really what is a paid what is a can I mean if you like look at it Can you see like a paid versus unpaid? Like does it show in some sort of way?

Kendra Ash
Oh, are you on here right now?

Chi Ejimofor
I'm looking at I'm watching you.

Kendra Ash
Okay. So see, um, here's one With 3411 we do both. We do contract stuff and we do invoicing. So on here, like I have this invoice, which I was actually sent over for a change order and I just have the invoice number written as change order number ten because you don't do change orders in QuickBooks. And um then I have in the memo when it was submitted. I Submit in textura 108. So that means that I submit it for billing in October, even though the invoid the change order was done in September. And then when we get paid, probably won't be till we usually get paid 60 days after. So we'll get paid in December for that invoice. But then there's other ones that we just email because this is this A invoice, that would be dust controls, that would be Don, and they're paying those separately This T F invoice that's some rental equipment that they're paying separately and it's just whatever the contractor decides of how they want to pay it and so see those are zero out.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
They will have all these ones that um still have balances. And that's because that's the retention.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, but it okay, I see, I see. So but it's like it's literally ten percent though. So it's like technically if there was some formula or something or not always
Kendra Ash
Is it sometimes it's five or ten are ten is the most common. Five is the second most common, but sometimes they can have you seven point five Like right now, one of my jobs just went down to one percent. So I mean and and they change during the project also. They can change and then they can pay out some of it and I don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
This is in the c this is in the contract though, probably. Or not in the original contract, no.

Kendra Ash
The retention changes as the co but wait, yes. The vi when how it starts off, yes, but it can change during the contract also that would be in there because they wouldn't have known that ahead of time. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
And they But it never it never increases. Obviously if it's gonna change it would decrease. And they They communicate that I guess somewhere.

Kendra Ash
Yes. Somehow. Yes. Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Is it clear? I mean is it like, hey, retention, I don't know.

Kendra Ash
They'll just they'll email me, they'll kick out my billing and reject it And then they'll tell me why. And then I have to redo it. That's how I find it.

Chi Ejimofor
What does that mean? Kick out.

Kendra Ash
Look at these jobs. Just here's some examples. Okay, well here's Atlas Kerlin, which this one they do both. They do As they do invoicing and they do contract doing. So that's why we some invoices are at zero, some invoices have the ten percent. So that's just how they do that one. Atlas Mesa, everything has been contract. Um and then we have Legacy North apartments and townhomes, which we still have not. Got the contract set up in Textura. We started doing work in December of last year. This happens too, this is not the I mean, for to go this long is a little bit uncommon, but it's happened several times in my life. And then we did more work and I think it was July that the job actually started and we really got the contracts. But now still they haven't set us in a texture. So until I get into texture, I cannot fill any of the contract stuff. And now I'm not ever gonna be able to update my memo So when I finally do it, no one's gonna know when it was submit for like when we should be paid or when it when it was what it was submit with. And then when you get a payment that's missing retention, it's really hard to figure out well what the heck is this for? Especially like when Don gets checks and she didn't bill it and doesn't know it that's where it's starting to get just more confusing with the whole QuickBooks thing, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so um okay, so QuickBooks is not that you really care about any of that. I'm just no I'm ca I mean it's interesting.

Kendra Ash
It doesn't work.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
A choice just is not the best situation for us. We definitely need some different software.

Chi Ejimofor
Interesting, okay. Um yeah, um okay. Okay, okay, okay. Uh and you said that they whenever you message them or you do something you send in something and then they kick it
Kendra Ash
out your something and then if I'll send in a billing, they'll reject it.

Chi Ejimofor
So you send an invoice you send an invoice which is the same as billing.

Kendra Ash
Uh well no, no a pay app. If I send in like a pay app, which cause just an invoice is just an invoice, but yeah, pay apps are the monthly contract applications that have to go in by either AIA, Textura, Procore. GC Pay or Premier.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so that's not an invoice, it's through their app thing.

Kendra Ash
Yes. Okay, so we'll be an invoice in Textura. I mean not Textura, what am I saying? In um QuickBooks 'cause that's how we track it. So we put them in there and then so yeah, it's like we double do everything.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Like that. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And but they'll you'll get a You'll get an e what is that can do you have one of those email what does one of those emails look like for fun? Like what kind which which one? One of the emails where y it'll get rejected and say it'll say something.

Kendra Ash
I don't have any rejection ones left right now because I get rid of of them because I get so many emails like even just texture I have it all go to a separate folder because I get hundreds and hundreds of them a month. Okay. So they'll either tell us I have to complete invoicing so apparently I Uh I don't oh I did actually get one kicked out today, but um I don't remember why. But so then you get 'em when you wanna if they have to go when you sign the invoice, when you sign the leave lean waiver Here this one wasn't included in the draw this month. Um if compliance were on hold because we had to see this one. We have not gotten our insurance certs yet And but that's one that we got started working on before we ever got a contract. So then we get the contract late and then they start freaking out at us because we don't get the contract in that day and get our C SIP and insurance done and they get mad at us, but it's not really our fault because they didn't send us a freaking contract beforehand anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
But it's always you know like our issue Yeah. Okay, so there's a whole thing so it's always an emergency. Everything's always an emergency. Yeah. Okay, so that's a whole thing. Uh that's a whole thing Yeah, okay. Yeah, my first uh yeah, it's interesting. Okay. But I guess the whatever they call the project, if it matches up with the whatever they c they're calling it, generally if it should match with whatever's on their contract.

Kendra Ash
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, ahead of time. I have to set up the contracts and all the um sites and put in a schedule of values. Or even if we do AIAs um manually, I have to set those up and then I submit them to the customers and then they approve them. You know, so I just have to that's the other reason why I have to always know what is on an estimate and what's included in a contract because that's how we bill and if I don't know what schedule values is and I can't put it together. Well and of course obviously when we do the work then I don't know what is included and if something's not and we need a change order or, you know, it's it gets very, very confusing.

Chi Ejimofor
So whenever we get a contract in you at the beginning of a project checking blah blah you know check check Before we start the project, you're going into whatever site they have and setting these things up?

Kendra Ash
Oh well, not necessarily. It's w whenever they decide to give us like I just told you on 3411 those jobs we still aren't even set up in Texture us till today and we started last December. So again it's whenever the customer gets us set up and so they'll set up the job and then I have to go in and set up the schedule values and set call these and
Chi Ejimofor
If I call them right now every day for a week, are they gonna get it set up?

Kendra Ash
Like Um well, I don't know. I mean they wouldn't back in December, but since July I would think they would. But I just emailed them again during billing time and said, Hey And they have not responded to me. Last month when I emailed them they said, Oh my god, we're working on it, we'll get it taken care of and then this month they just didn't even respond.

Chi Ejimofor
So apparently Is that something we should be annoying about
Kendra Ash
I mean Oh god for sure, but nobody has time.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
So if you're if somebody's talking about it. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yes, definitely.

Chi Ejimofor
Um so this is technically it is it's uh not technically, it is um it is a part of like the like tech whatever you Um is this included in the contract? How do you know what they use?

Kendra Ash
Is it No, this part would be something that I would take care of normally and I would keep bugging people but I don't have time. 'cause of the other part of all the contract stuff that I have to do. So if I could just be part where all the contracts would just come to me and they'd already be set up and finished and I would know what the schedule values is then I could be on all these customers for change orders and you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Well even I guess like getting access. Well I don't even know who what email is getting access, but even I guess at the beginning of a project where it's like, hey by the way, what do you use to pay like and do we have access?

Kendra Ash
Yes, they always they always list it in their contracts. It'll tell you if either using Textura or GC pay or Trocor or whatever they're using. Or just if you need to submit um a monthly AIA bill, they will they it always lists it in the contract. Of course if we don't have a contract, then we just guess and we usually just send an invoice and then wait until they send it back and say this is not acceptable and then they tell us so Kinda just depends. But always if we get a contract, it will tell you. So we we could I mean that would be another thing that if we were always just calling the customer, you know, where's our contract? Where's our contract?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But Just that doesn't happen either.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay.

Kendra Ash
Here, but now that we're talking about it, I will email these people again
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
And saying hello
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so after okay, and s so generally right now, after we get after we get a contract or something, or even an invoice or a project, whatever it is Uh we find out on billing day, invoice day, uh you know whether you have access or whether or not you the thing is correct. I mean you find out after the fact at some point.

Kendra Ash
No, it re I just I'm telling you it's different with every job.

Chi Ejimofor
Sure, okay.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, it's it really is. It's different with every job. So it just depends on what the customer sends us.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
I can tell you one customer, MT Builders. They're amazing They always send us a contract. They always are in Textura for SWIP, but everything else, they let us invoice them. And that's how they are on every single job because they have their billing department makes the rules, not the project manager. So that's the one customer. Everyone should run like MT builders. They're awesome.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah. Nice, okay.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, but that's the only one I can give you any real information on because they are all different.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay Um okay. So it's not it's not there's not okay, so depending on the thing, some people have Do they do you get a login personally, like with your email, or how does that go? Do you have to request a login?

Kendra Ash
How how do you get a login? Our well depends. Pocor they they will send people um invites for each job and um but then GC pay our c our Our company is just set up. So when they go and add a job to us, we already have the login. Texture is the same thing. Um premiere, I guess that's the same way to you. Premier's a noob site that only a handful of people use and it's terrible So it's very strange and doesn't work very well. But um that must be the same way. So I guess Tokor is the only one that actually sends out individual invites for each project.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so the other ones it's okay. Shh all right.

Kendra Ash
But yeah, the other ones we're our company is just set up on them and they just add them to their and then go in. We have a setup. Yeah, and we have our emails set up.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Kendra Ash
So I get everywhere every time I cut like when a job's set up, I automatically get an email sent out to me from Techura.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, just get an invite. So all these goes all those people really do is need to hit a drop down and Click your name click our name and just it's should be done.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
I don't know how it works on that end, but well except there's also there are a couple customers. Ryan Companies is one of them, but hardly any. But some of them they set up our schedule values for us. So sometimes that can take them a little bit longer, but Ninety-five percent of them do not and we have to set them up ourselves. So I think all it should have to be is a drop down box and yes, check us that yes, this is you know what I mean, put in the dollar amount of the contract and you're done.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
So I don't understand why sometimes it takes so long.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um, I need to plug in this computer. Okay, I think that's okay. Okay. And so you do the billing for SWIP Uh and tempted. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Have you seen our rental um spreadsheet?

Chi Ejimofor
No.

Kendra Ash
Here, I'll show you. Yeah, what I don't even uh did Don show you our um swe our inspection master spreadsheet? Yes. Okay Yes. So um rental I think I should do rental too. Oh, well maybe yeah, well he's been he's been I he's seen a lot of Uh yes. So um if you go into where was I oh in the data drive, it's just under customer rental master.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Down on the first p you know the first one. And so this is this is how we've tracked our rental items for seventeen years now We just have a list in here where we enter the customer. So this is just another place where so you get it in the work completed. Then you have to put it in the invoice and then you have to put it in whatever billing system you're using and then you have to put it in here and just remember to anything we have like grates, temp fence, you know, water ramps, whatever. um you have to put it in here enter the customer and the information and then we just um do by bill through date and every month we go in here and sort it and go down and bill it Just that way.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you delete things from here?

Kendra Ash
Well we don't delete anything. Once we're done, that's what I was gonna show you. So if we are done with something, we cut it and we paste it in build and verify just like the Swiftmaster.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, but we don't put amounts I don't see any amounts for temp fence is for example, but I guess it's fine.

Kendra Ash
Oh there are none. There are t the amount is not in there because We it's in no it's impossible to track. No one has time. I mean it wouldn't be impossible if you actually had time, but it changes so often. Because you go out and install something and then they need more fence. Then a month later they call and they want you to come take down some fence. Then they have yeah, so we we are It's you have to if so if you want to know how much was out there at a specific time you go into QuickBooks and look at the invoice because I track it on each invoice But we do not keep it updated in here.

Chi Ejimofor
Probably how much temp fence do we have right now? How much temp fence do we own?

Kendra Ash
Oh gosh.

Chi Ejimofor
Is there just no way?

Kendra Ash
No a lot.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Ton.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, my accused to everyone. The last time we went through it was when Tim was buying the company Don and I went through this list and just went through and looked at every invoice and totaled up over here.

Chi Ejimofor
what the tempt feds and that was over here but it's not there anymore. What happened to the No. Well all of those are most of those have been picked up and see there's still some.

Kendra Ash
Oh I guess like the outstanding yeah but I mean once it's been removed then it goes away, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
So um they never yeah, no. And I know Tim's bought fence since then, so whatever we have that but and then of course no one tracks all the stuff that comes in that's damaged that gets thrown away So that's not really accounted for. I mean it's accounted for on the invoices, but it's not like accounted for on any
Chi Ejimofor
And I don't know anything by the way, but I mean magic, I mean I I I remember from a YouTube video, I mean if if like uh you own stuff and there's taxes and depreciation or something, is that a thing? Is that a thing? We don't do see yeah, and that's the other thing.

Kendra Ash
Um I don't know how it works with him because when Mike owned the company it was very, very different because he was the only owner He did everything by cash. You know what I mean? It was like his accounting was done that way. So it was very, very different how we did anything and what we needed to do So what needs to happen going forward, but I've always even when Tam Mike when Mike owned it, I was like, don't you need to know or want to track, you know, how many track upgrades you you have and your fence and how many you know what I mean? I mean, I don't even well I think they do have that now with Roloff and Porter John because of Crow 'Cause that system is actually our system.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
You know, so they should have that. But everything else, no.

Chi Ejimofor
'Cause that I don't know. I don't know how it works. I don't know how taxes work. Do you do who does taxes? Does somebody do taxes? I don't either. What well how is t I guess to the do you guys have you hired a firm every year to to kind of do taxes? Or is that like the owner like literally does it by himself?

Kendra Ash
I used to have a we used to have um outside accountants.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yes. Um, I guess it's the first year that um that Tim's owned it. Did he do well how'd they do taxes last this last the year w since he's owned it?

Kendra Ash
Oh, well since um I don't even know what it's called now that I'm my brain is shot after all this um, but okay, so but yeah, Mike would just do like Mike didn't even how Mike had it We've ne we never had to lock anything. We never had to um like he wouldn't even do any of the crap, I can't even think of the word. You know Rec reconciliations.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
He wouldn't do that till like one he'd do one at the end of the year for since January and then he'd be asking us questions. So what happened here in February? Well, I don't freaking know You know, I mean, 'cause there was just he had his was very easy and then now we have to have audits. They have to close periods all the time, they have to send in, you know reports and all that so how it's even done now they've not really ever discussed that with us. That's completely different and it's all new since Tim came on So.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yes. Tim Dawn.

Kendra Ash
And then Don wasn't always here either. We had someone else in for a little while.

Chi Ejimofor
Was Was Don't not very helpful. Okay, yeah.

Kendra Ash
And then we got Mr. Don and he really just hasn't had time to go over much of it because he came in in the middle of the audit and had to clean all that up.

Chi Ejimofor
And so yeah, he's only been here since I think May. Okay.

Kendra Ash
So wild.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So truly, we're all behind, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
And but now it's fence. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Okay, so it's fence, it's greats.

Kendra Ash
Um There's water ramps, there's water donkeys, there's um else to make print. Oh backflows, we rent a lot of backflows.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And hoses, I guess, okay.

Kendra Ash
Hoses, yes, which ugh, that's I hate renting hoses. Like sometimes we make a lot of money off of 'em, but they're always shot when w when they're done. Yeah, so it's monster used to just sell them and Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So it's yeah, ramps, donkeys, fence, grates, backflow hoses. And okay, I I'll have to learn what a water donkey and a water ramp is. Are those associated with something?

Kendra Ash
I mean Well, they go to I it has something to do with m hooking up to the meter and backflow.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So that you can fill trucks. Except the water ramps. The water ramps are just they go on the road if you have to have hoses to go across the road and you will drive over them, you know, so you put the water ramps over hoses so that people can drive over and not wreck them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then great okay. Okay, cool. Um Okay. Okay. Um nice. Okay, okay. Uh let's see here. Okay, so best of all the worlds, like you're just sitting there doing Like billing by basically only. Like you're sitting there and then you maybe you're doing like you have to do checks on the contract, the final, just to be like uh Because you have to do the schedule values but in general with best world is like you're sitting there just throwing out invoices following up on invoices Checking into the systems.

Kendra Ash
And getting into the C SIP and OSIP shit set up. and getting the contracts fixed and correct so I can get them signed and get them back to the customer and then any other paperwork which Don helps me out a lot on now um that they need. So there's that because no matter what you're doing, you have to stop whatever you're doing to get that done. But then of course Billing, you only have a few days when you get the notice and I do hundreds and hundreds of um contract billings a month
Dawn Wagner
Kendra there's just a lot, so what op open your text message. Oh
Kendra Ash
Oh my God. So he doesn't like your cold temperatures either.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm sitting here. And there's also mosquitoes. I don't do mosquitoes. I usually have my hat.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah, usually he has his hat off Are you freezing him out?

Chi Ejimofor
No seventy-four man.

Kendra Ash
Oh that's yeah, that's freezing.

Chi Ejimofor
Freezing He needs to be, I don't know.

Dawn Wagner
He he's like this, it's ninety outside. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't play with I don't play with my temperatures, you know.

Dawn Wagner
I thought you'd enjoy that, Kendra.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, that was because That would be me when I was there. Well actually, Don and I would cut Don would be sweating.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah, I forgot.

Kendra Ash
You used to have your both be in the same room. Oh, do we need to put the take down?

Chi Ejimofor
No, no, no, you're good. You're good. I have mine.

Dawn Wagner
I thank you a kick out of that. That is that is funny. But he has a scarf.

Chi Ejimofor
The scarf's new. I'm a big fan of the scarves. Scarves are a top five clothing item for sure.

Dawn Wagner
I said you thought you were clothed. My heater runs 24-7 here.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, I should maybe well I have a little heater. Anyway, it's all good.

Kendra Ash
There was a big ass heater here. I don't know what happened but yes, where is it?

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know how we took it. Where's it at? Should we bring it up?

Dawn Wagner
I always had a heater I'll find it.

Chi Ejimofor
I would have it on my feet. Okay, let's see. Let me look at my random charts and see if there's any random questions that jump out. Um Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, okay, okay. Okay, that looks decent in general. Uh so in general I have oof So the directors are I mean this is directors are pulled like five ways as far as I'm uh not pulled five ways, but I have as the for the directors, I have basically Ooh, where did I write it down? Okay, I had it. Where did I write it down? Uh Oh okay, I had that work can become in several ways. I had Customer contacts the director email call text. Actually, I'll just email uh I'll just copy this. She's like this. I have One, two, three, four, five. Probably a couple can be combined, but this is what I have. Where where are you? Okay Oh, that's terrible. Why is it um Okay. Okay With the I have it uh if you look at the teams uh can you see the chat? I don't know if you see the chat. Oh let me Well I can just say it. Well, yeah the customer contacts the director Directly.

Dawn Wagner
There you go, mister. There's your head.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh there it is, right there.

Dawn Wagner
Okay, now I can see it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah, um okay. I pasted it twice unfortunately. But Yeah, call customer contacts the director, email call text directly. Call customer contacts the desert services general line and the answering service emails the director And the director calls them back. Site services contacts the director. Email, call, text. And then the customer contacts the director, which is the same as number one, but it's in response to a inspector. And then there's a contract. Do you think that covers everything? Sure. That's confusing to me, but Uh I think I should probably combine uh I should probably combine a couple of them. The first is the customer contacts the director And um could be I because what I'm hearing is that people will just call him up.

Kendra Ash
Then probably me, then you know, 'cause everyone's just always had my information You think it would all just go to Jared since he sent the estimates out, but it doesn't always so and then sometimes yes it'll still go to Rick or um Brandon or Lacey. Sometimes but yes, sometimes even Karen or Don, but those you know, those are very random. And then Jason too it can go to.

Chi Ejimofor
Or I guess they won't they won't tell them about the a con but they'll like they'll contact directors can be contacted directly.

Kendra Ash
They'll send an email and say, hey, I have a contract for you. I need you to get out here. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Or we're or we're getting a contract for you. But yeah, mostly just because of it goes to Jerry or me, just because they have my name listed on all the um Um all the e-docs and stuff come to me.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So normally.

Kendra Ash
Like sometimes now they yeah. But yes. Uh so that's for contracts.

Chi Ejimofor
For contracts.

Dawn Wagner
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh but then okay, so for contracts that's how ends so And obviously that would go to ultimately the delivery people, uh the directors to fulfill. Correct. But people can call the directors directly. Yes. And directors I guess at least the the two hand um the two manual guys will just throw that on their schedule. And then get it built. And then the other people might get that in email. Well, let me see. Right. I mean are the Crow people Are the Crow are the Crow are the two people on Crow decent about getting I guess okay Steven no but is new but Steven's new right Jason always was but um
Kendra Ash
Um um um I forget whose uh What's what's her name?

Chi Ejimofor
I can't tell you I'm Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

Kendra Ash
Wendy, yeah, so no Wendy is not because she's just never I don't think she's She's never had to, so no. She doesn't do that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
She just they give 'em a call just like Kelly and Sweeper. They get a call, they just put it on the schedule Kelly writes it in his handy dandy notebook.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes.

Kendra Ash
At least Kelly, I mean at least Wendy has to put it in Crow, so I mean all the eggs information's actually in something. You know what I mean? There's just not a approval from a customer.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh, Jason, okay. Uh-da di okay. In Uh Daniel Dan, does he He does the email? Um yes, no? Um he Or is that kind of managed by someone else?

Kendra Ash
That's kind of a hit or miss thing. But Don is usually there. Miss Don is usually there too. Um Make sure he sees things and gets on them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh So he it's yes or no, maybe email, maybe not, but he okay. We'll see. Oh, I I think he okay
Kendra Ash
Well he does some I mean he has and he really tries. I mean I think he's better than a lot of you. You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
He really he really does.

Kendra Ash
He's not been in that position that long.

Chi Ejimofor
He's probably been in it for shortest amount of time. That's what he said, yeah.

Kendra Ash
Um You know.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So it's really okay, Stephen's new. Okay, so it's really just Jason. Okay, Wendy Kelly. Wendy Kelly. Yeah, so it's really okay. And those two are the yeah, okay, I can remember those pretty easily. Uh we have seven lines technically, but it's really like Yeah. Five. I mean it's really like why did why do I say that? It's really like five to me. Because Dan Dan and Wendy are like separate. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yeah. When a customer wants a roll off and a portage on and some SWIP and they're like, okay, well you need to call him for this and you need to call him for this and then big that's not something we want to do anymore. We did it for many years, but we're working on not doing that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay.

Kendra Ash
You know, 'cause when the customer contacts one person they still have to contact one person and we should get them what they need, you know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Which has gotten better with you know, we'll send emails to everyone and then they'll just take care of each but yeah, I mean some kind of tracking something will probably be A little better? I don't know. Yeah, I was Of course though, I am not a computer person, so I don't know if there's what there is.

Chi Ejimofor
There's an infinite, you know, there's like I mean there's I was gonna say, you know, with construction stuff, there's as many uh for as every company that exists, there's probably a software company that exists to manage the work. And then there's also all the project management stuff that's like you know even just for general people. Uh so there's like infinite stuff really.

Kendra Ash
But Right. I'm sure there is.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But yeah, since I've been stuck in desert services all this time, I don't know what's out there per se. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
There's probably better Yeah, things are not. But yeah, I mean I when I yeah, when I first uh well yeah when I I don't know, maybe a couple da last week at the end of the week I was like, this does seem like, you know, project management. You know between all of them. You know like this sounds like what I've been doing. You know, what do we need? We need all these things and then you coordinate all of them. Um but instead we yeah, this this one's interesting. Yeah. It could be and still I mean it does ma I mean I back in I look at my uh history, it's it was the same as not the same. But I mean, yeah, it was probably the f my first company out of school. Yeah, I mean it was the same in that like yeah you have like five things that you need according to your customer and you just contact the people that are in charge of those and make sure you get them. And you keep on you keep track of those things until it closes out and then you make sure your customer gets billed. Yeah, you make sure your customer gets billed, you make sure your projects you know uh y you know, uh uh being, you know uh uh whatever th you make sure the billing of your project is correct and then you track it all the way until it's until it's done.

Kendra Ash
Right. It's like by yourself is like how it goes. You have like project coordinators who each have so many jobs They don't have all of this and all of this and you know it's like okay you get these jobs and you take care of Billy. those and tracking those and you know with your project manager. Yeah, we'll have I've seen like this entire section of what this company owns and I'm not sure.

Chi Ejimofor
Like 'Cause it is like I mean at the at the end of the day it it is like a you need like a manager of those people and those sections. So it still makes sense to have like a head
Kendra Ash
You know, you somebody has to manage all the bodies and the schedules. But then yeah for them it's running right now it's not you can't really grow.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah. There's there's uh well what I see is immediately Uh, you know, there's no way to immediately see the forecast it's no way to forecast material wise or people wise on anything. It's like how much tempfence do we have? How much is coming back? How much is Outstanding, you know, it's like are we are we gonna like in in t three months are you gonna have like ten thousand, you know Temp fence great.

Kendra Ash
They're start they're starting to like um Mr. Dawn is trying to you know starting to do things like yeah, he's asking Father Day about Um like when are these jobs ending?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Like what? We have never tracked winds are you know what I mean? Like that's just not something we've ever even looked at.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Because it's just not, yeah. And well You know, we can have the manpower, so like I said before ten, we have five people who ran everything. So, um but you know You But we still don't. And but yes, if we could get someone smart like you and to find some software that would help.

Chi Ejimofor
Well it's it's a software thing. It's a software thing and then it's like you have to have I think it's like an interesting organization thing as well 'cause it's like I mean historically I mean I can manage a hundred you know I can manage an ungodly amount of like let's say not manage but let's say like I can keep track of an ungodly amount of stuff but then you're like Sh can I follow up with an ungodly amount of stuff? Like maybe maybe maybe not. I don't know. I wouldn't have so much audacity to say I could keep up on like a I don't know how many, you know It's like site it's I mean, it's gotta be there's gonna be either like you're hiring PMs or you're just hiring a bunch of account managers and the account managers are managed managing these things like PMs. Um so it might be anyway, but this is this is I'm just I'm just talking shit.

Kendra Ash
You know, I'm not I'm not allowed to talk it's just interesting and I hope you can figure out because that would be great.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm just talking I'm just just thinking out loud. But okay, I don't think there's any Yeah, 'cause I'm just I'm just like It always helps to think out loud. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Talking to your s yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, 'cause I'm just talking in my in my you know, y you can but yeah, it seems yeah, it seems like yeah, i i it the sales thing is probably you have you probably needs to be s like you have actual Str sales people and then you have probably I would call them project managers who are on site going around and they maybe have I don't know if it's commission or what, but they're doing upsells on their own, but it's like Uh-huh. There's specific points I've seen actually that's a good question. Well, I've s heard that well, I don't know if you're from I've heard that when people get dust perm what dust permits we can see all of them and then s we could be like everybody that gets a dust permit we could be hitting them up Uh you know, I heard I've heard that I've heard that whenever there's a last inspection that yes somebody that we could be doing the cleaning and I heard that one person James said he suggested James said he's been proactively asking people if they want he has
Kendra Ash
He definitely has. Yes. And I was like, that sounds like everybody, which I don't know, maybe Jared Sense has set something up now, but we've never had anything set up before and I know
Chi Ejimofor
Ooh interesting. So if a project is is a year like multiple years.

Kendra Ash
Especially if we pulled it, we should be contacting them when it's expiring to let them know and we're gonna, you know, renew it for them. But most of the time, well we never have in the past, it just waits until it expires and then they call us and they say, What the heck? And a lot of them think that it should have been our responsibility to track in the first place because we pulled it and were their sort people.

Chi Ejimofor
Ah yeah makes sense so that's something that I've always said we should
Kendra Ash
should definitely track and it really you can ask Jared he might have put something in to place that does it's just he we wouldn't it wouldn't be up to date yet because of the fact that they only explain fire once a year and Jared has not been here. He wasn't doing the permits at first. So like a whole full year I don't think has even come around. So I would I I'm not positive, but I would ask him about that. Because that means set to be something that we do do.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And I don't even think that'd be anything hard. No. You know?

Kendra Ash
You put it in a calendar or something and it pops up and I I don't you know what I mean? You know.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, I think I have a pretty now I'm uh uh I think I'm uh I think I understand what I think I have a pretty good base. I will say the QuickBooks thing is is a little bit nasty. I don't know uh but I would say outside of QuickBooks If I was forced to then I would say that it has to be tracked. Um I guess that is I I rem I sp I'm I'm I'm literally I remember at the last company I well not the last company, it was like five companies. But yeah, I was we were forced to keep track of our own I wasn't I don't think I was sending invoices, but I was keeping track of it, you know. So I was hitting up the I was like, Hey does you know, did you send this invoice? Hey, did we get it back yet? You know and I'm not sure what I'm saying. like I'm the contact for the ty you know it was like I'm in charge of that.

Kendra Ash
So right. Uh or if they're adding something to the contract that wasn't originally in fact I'm in and working on also getting well I mean because really in the real in I mean we really should be getting the change order before we even do it.

Chi Ejimofor
I was saying and change orders like ever I mean we're talking about this is like is again I'm like this is a what a project manager's is supposed to do this is like project managers submitting things you know, this is like what you're trained to do, or if you don't have if you're not trained, like this is like you know You at at some level some project managers are like, Yeah, you're literally sending the invoices, maybe you're literally submitting the change orders. Maybe not doing the invoicing specifically, but you're like, Yeah, you're getting the change order done.

Kendra Ash
Yes, they usually do do the change order you know they have well someone they'll t ask someone to get the change order request ready for them but then they follow through with it and yes yeah
Chi Ejimofor
And then you track things down. So that's like my I'm like, yeah, really I I don't even it like to change the whole you know, I don't know to change the whole obviously be like the It's like insane. But yeah, to just track everything outside of it, it makes a lot of sense.

Kendra Ash
Like to me it's always a surprise. Yeah. Because I have have no idea what we're doing until I go to bill for it. And then when I go to bill for it, I realize it's something brand new that was never even in the contract. So that's the kind of thing that shouldn't happen. That we should know ahead of time that it's not, you know, you know, and that's how we could get the change order request out to them right away and get it change order and yeah, so it shouldn't just be all of a sudden they want you to bill that month and oh shit I can't because this wasn't even on the contract, you know. So there's just stuff like that that well all those things. Yes. That some kind of project management software could I probably I'll have like I'll
Chi Ejimofor
I'll what is I'll have a uh I was gonna say I'll I'll probably have uh it'll be illegal, so I can't tell Tim. No, when I say when I say that 'cause he wants me I'll probably have this like master god list of projects and I'm just like low-key secretly project managing them. Not like, you know, you know what I mean, but just like seeing if it works. And then slowly one day I'll just be like, by the way, I'll show like two people. This is what I've been doing. Um I used to I mean that was what I was w at the last um At the last job we had a contract with with uh Pfizer, but we they had all these little little projects, little equipment installations. You know, it's like 10K, 20K projects. You know, you just had to coordinate like four or five different things. And so it just I just had this massive list, but you know, with every project. Yeah, with every project there was only like at any time there was like you know, any day there was like two things that need to be checked up on. So it wasn't ever so you even though you have like a hundred projects in a list, like it's like three you just check on three things in a day. You know, and then it keeps it keeps on going until until something happens. Yeah. And that lady, uh the sounds like that that uh Don Lady. Um the the HR, she's something she has a lot of experience uh you know in this genre HR wise. Yeah I talked to her a little bit. She was she was uh Uh I was like, oh shoot. She sounded interesting.

Kendra Ash
Oh no, too. Yeah, I don't know yet. So well actually I saw her in our meeting but I didn't know. Yes she was. Okay For just a little while. But that was when I found out we have a third Don. Miss Don, I I we get Miss Don and Mr. Don confused all the time. That's gonna be missed. I don't know. Oh it could be Don one, two, and three.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know.

Kendra Ash
We're gonna have to figure something out. Primary Dawn Secondary No I'm primary Alright. Of course you are Don, because you're number one. You were first. Right? Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um again I have signed stuff. I talked to uh Karen about that. Do you um check care you check other people's invoice billings or anything like that? Or
Kendra Ash
people they have okay cool uh no only I mean like I'm not look at them if um they're on contract billing but yeah that's yeah no not really
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. So you're swimped uh a swip and and then all the swip and temp fence. I guess temp fence is like Yeah well I think it goes on.

Kendra Ash
Yeah, I was I don't I was yeah. You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I agree. That's when I when I saw it as a separate I know it's probably a separate
Kendra Ash
People want it maybe separately, but like when I was looking at it, I'm like this is I don't even differentiate company.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
And then we bought a temp fence company.

Chi Ejimofor
I see, yes.

Kendra Ash
And so we start so that's just the way it was always put in from when Mike was here, but now it if I think and you know it should just be together, but whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh tempfense is always on the SWIP schedule
Kendra Ash
basically or yes yes or yes yes correct yep and it's the swip crews that do it so yep
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh, and then okay Uh who okay how where is where does Backflow and I guess it is d are greats the same as Temp Fans? Are they installed the same?

Kendra Ash
Yes, they're they're There's SWIP.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. And then backflows is that in is that uh scheduled is that on the SWIP schedule?

Kendra Ash
It's all on the SWIP schedule. Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. And so when the project starts, it sounds like backflow stuff. What Karen's getting in contact to figure that stuff out. The backflow?

Kendra Ash
If they have a water meter.

Chi Ejimofor
If they have a water meter.

Kendra Ash
Only if they have a water meter. If they don't have a water meter, then it just comes from it just goes on the swim schedule and Karen doesn't have to deal with with it.

Chi Ejimofor
So if they if they don't have a water meter, like the whole process, like we would do the we would We do the whole process for them.

Kendra Ash
Right. Well but and it it just depends on the city because some cities uh supply everything. Excuse me themselves and then other cities don't. So if if we do the water meter and the city doesn't provide the backflow and do the um certification then yes we automatically do.

Chi Ejimofor
Does the main Maricopa, do you know that? Well it's not Maricopa because it's actually the city. Uh by the city. Okay, so I have to depends on the city. Okay. So depending on the city, so if they have a water meter, even okay, so it always depends on the city regardless.

Kendra Ash
Yes, if they write what they they provide.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh is the are they usually knowledgeable about that or is that The so the people who yeah, the people who say we have the concept challenge about it? Yeah, yeah.

Kendra Ash
No.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
No.

Chi Ejimofor
So And normally that's another thing.

Kendra Ash
We don't really like to do meters it is uh because we don't really make much money off of them and it is a lot of work because they don't know anything about them and A lot we have to figure so Karen always has to figure out um if they're even if it's a private meter or not and a lot of times it's a private meter and then they have to have special information. will just have us do all the work and then they'll go okay never mind we'll just pull it ourselves after we do it so really in the that's not something we really want to sell and we've talked to Tim about even and he kind of he agreed you know he was like yeah let's not push them but obviously if it's a customer that you know wants everything we will but it's yeah there a pain to do on a lot of different custom a di different um cities. It really depends too
Chi Ejimofor
on the cities but there's no side and there's no I mean I guess we could it's not set up but there's no like matrix of what it it happens.

Kendra Ash
Okay we have in the customer rental master We have um a just an Excel spreadsheet in there that tells you like different things about like city of Phoenix. It's hundred six hundred fifty dollars. We provide the backflow. Um city of surprise is six hundred dollars unless it's Epcor. City of Surprise is split so you just have to find out. Epcor does have to at the city of s different areas of city of surprise and then you have to go through Epcar, which is eleven hundred dollars, and you have to meet them on site and they install and certify the backflow. But if it's City of Surprise, I'm pretty sure we do the s the but yeah, we just have a list in there that we've made and um like trying to keep track of them but other Other than that, yeah, we don't have anything. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
We don't have any matrix anything.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, well that's I mean this is something. This is a big I mean this is a lot.

Kendra Ash
This is like customers pricing and but and then the thing though is now we've had a lot of them change things and we don't know that things are changed like oh like what was I think it's the city of Peoria all of a sudden um They after a year they can go pull the meter and they don't tell you because if you don't up if you don't call them and pay again to get it updated for the following year
Chi Ejimofor
So these people like technically so really it's like uh probably a day maybe or something. We just need to call through and just make sure. Is that a calling thing or is that just like looking up? What are we looking up even? What is this?

Kendra Ash
Like hydrant meter stuff? Yeah, yeah. Well, you uh usually it takes at least a week to get put in. It takes several days to go through them to make sure to get the meter approved and depending on which city it is, but or and if it's a private If it's a private hydrant, you can actually get them, but you have to send them special um paperwork to have the private owner fill out
Chi Ejimofor
We can get um I guess I'm saying like can we get like it's like if you go to the city's website, it there's like there's s is it is there some of them yes.

Kendra Ash
I'm sure there are I mean several of them. I just yeah, I haven't looked recently, but that's how we used to get them.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. You know.

Kendra Ash
But now there are a lot there's just different stuff. So Karen, you you ends up having to call just because of getting certain meters approved and then the customers want to move and it just it's just kind of a mess so it just not sucks something that actually we could do it but we should charge more than a five hundred dollar fee to do all of it to get it done.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
You know, that would probably be the best thing to do is Up our price on that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that's that stuff backflow. Okay. Dust signs, dust permits, getting contact. Um Okay, okay. Uh Have you ever uh I guess I only have maybe a couple more, maybe two more things. I mean, have you touched
Kendra Ash
Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh CRO at all, like billing or anything?

Kendra Ash
No, I don't do anything with Crow.

Chi Ejimofor
Have you never touched it?

Kendra Ash
He's the only one that does that billing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Cool. Um Uh do you need timesheets or something for the billing you do or you just that's all you need is a schedule and do whatever else?

Kendra Ash
Yes. I do not need timesheets.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh does this line it I mean this this uh it's on here officially this whip master this makes okay I'm gonna say this makes sense to you. Uh let's just go to one of them just for uh okay. Wait, okay. It's it's pink. Okay, so you go to You have to jeez, wait, so is there anything on here that hasn't been built? Let me just double check.

Kendra Ash
Uh uh I don't think there's a ton of stuff that hasn't been built.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh okay, at the top, yeah.

Kendra Ash
Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
So okay, even like okay. Uh how do I go back to this? Man, Teams is look at me not even knowing how to use Teams. I don't know how I don't know how to get back to you the c to the call.

Kendra Ash
I'm like what I like clicked away from the call and I'm like I can't see this shared screen. think you're because I went on there to look at your list and now I oh it shows here wait maybe I can click on this.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah yeah. No, that's fine. That's good. That's good actually. Uh I was gonna ask, well if you want to show your screen, I was gonna ask uh well, I was just gonna ask about one of these, just like Just so I could start to begin to even understand what the h what the how how this is stuff is being like just build I guess or what you know, relocated. I'm looking at well, we could just name one.

Kendra Ash
Okay here, why don't we just show you one?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah yeah that's what I was gonna say. Yeah.

Kendra Ash
Um okay, I wanna do something that has a contract that we okay, our Terra wouldn't work.

Chi Ejimofor
Well what you could show me both like no contract and contract. I don't know if it's it's a whole it's a very different Oh my god. This is such a mess. Um Well this is interesting. Okay. Just real quick before you di before you do it. Uh-huh. So MT Builders, I see SWIP narrative on there and it says swip finished narrative will Herve will deliver. So this is like Maybe other work has been done on this, who knows? But that's not your business. Your business is only what's been completed.

Kendra Ash
No, it is all my business to know.

Chi Ejimofor
Or not your business, but to finish.

Kendra Ash
But like Okay, so MT Builders, that one is brand new.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
So here it is. Lehigh. The only thing that's on my invoice right now is the dust control sign because Karen sent me an email that the dust control sign was ready. So now that I have this in here, I would put script narrative because it's ready, but it's not being delivered yet. And then I just copy the invoice number paste it and then I move but what I would also do is now I would copy the name and find out what else we've done in currently or Or what is on the schedule to do. So find. So here's where it says deliver the safety manual.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so he'll be splitting it up. He'll be like splitting it up by okay something was done today, he'll split it off and mark it as needing to be built. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Right, so this is done. So it's still pink, so we haven't done any of that. So the narrative hasn't been delivered. Jason is just telling me here that it is done and ready. Which is good because then when if customers call 'cause that's something they need right away. And um if they call and need it, you know, we can say, Oh yep, it's ready, you know, we'll just get it straight but otherwise we don't deliver it until But we'll still bill for it, but we don't Well yes, but all I do is because this is contract, so I will put this on this invoice and it just says in the memo not submit.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Kendra Ash
And I just stays there and I will bill whatever we do for the next month until billing opens up again Again, which they're billing usually opens up around the 20th. So I'll get an email open an email invite to bill, and then I'll go in here, see what we've done, and I will submit it on the monthly billing and then I'll change my memo to submit in Textura on this date and then I know I cannot add any more to it.

Chi Ejimofor
When does when does the em the the memo thing freeze?

Kendra Ash
Um when Don closes it, which He needs to. Right now he's only closed them uh through July, but he has to start closing them every month. So if he closes this, so okay, because it was done in October, so he's supposed to close it the first week of November, but I'm not going to submit it for billing until November 20th at least. So then I can't update anything on it. So I can't update anything on it at all after he locks it the first week of the month, which is why there's a big problem with the whole system
Chi Ejimofor
And that's because of audits or something?

Kendra Ash
Yes, yes. Well and it's because of how they yeah, it has something to do with how they have to put Yes, stuff in for accounting. Which is because I don't know. I've done it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I talked to Dom for two seconds. He was like he was that's he said he was looking for somebody with experience outside of the company or outside with something similar to see how I AI A whatever this A I whatever this type of thing is.

Kendra Ash
AIA is yeah. What how it how it's normally Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
She's like it's how it's done outside of this 'cause it I mean that's obviously, you know, not I yes not ideal.

Kendra Ash
Yes. I mean it doesn't make sense.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean it doesn't make full sense, I don't know.

Kendra Ash
Um Yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Um people would not really like it if you build them in advance, would they? I don't know if that's a thing.

Kendra Ash
You can't. Okay. You can't. It's impossible. Alright.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh okay, and then the not submit thing. Okay, so I mean the not submit is wait wait okay so that's interest that's weird. Um Because the not submit is only on Well I was gonna ask. I was gonna ask. So like the not submit thing. Okay. So you to start the month, you start it, you put in you start putting in stuff and you you you have it as not submit, right? Correct. Okay, until then time comes to submit, but then whenever that time comes, most of the time it's like kind of closed to like change the memo thing. But you can still it hasn't been yet, but that's what that is saying we have to start. Ah, I see. You will have to start. Yeah, yeah. Yes, he did just do to July. Yep.

Kendra Ash
And he actually was gonna do through September a week and a half ago and I was like, You absolutely cannot, because I still have fifty percent of my billing.

Chi Ejimofor
I have hundreds of people left to bill, but I have to do this.

Kendra Ash
So he left it open. Um and so we could change those, but in the future I mean we've gotta fix something.

Chi Ejimofor
So in general in general it just has to be delayed by like a month, but and that's fine.

Kendra Ash
In a perfect world, that would be great.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
But apparently it's gonna be something that cannot continue to happen. So that's where there's one other big yeah. I don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's uh the corporate side. That's for the corporates to argue over. That's interesting though. Okay. So but uh I saw sometimes um Well, just as a as a question, like not sub um like is there a is there some sort of Uh yeah, can you put like, you know, not sub you know, not submitted until like October or November twenty seventh or something, you know, and it then it's like Or like texture you know what I mean?

Kendra Ash
Like more information, but you can't ch change the No, because I won't be able to update it if something happens. We still won't know when it we'll go through because and especially this is a brand new contract. Maybe in November they won't have us set up in Textura yet.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh I won't be able to fill it anyway.

Kendra Ash
And I'll have to wait until December So that note would be, you know, that you're going to be able to do that. So now everything we do until that point, they want everything billed on that, you know, on that month. So Really realistically we should be keeping them together everything that goes on that month. Yeah. So yeah, it's just a big thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes. Okay. Uh so you yeah, okay. So you sub generally for c so for contracts you submit you submit it uh every month Uh so just real quick expl so let's say so for this month, I don't know. So we had work that was done on site on the eighth, on the ninth, on the twel twelfth, and then that's it. That work would be built at on w whatever the next date that's upcoming for that person, right? Correct. Okay. So if if it was like the eighth, ninth and the twelfth and the and their little portal thing opens on the twentieth, then you would push everything on that day.

Kendra Ash
Correct.

Chi Ejimofor
Cool.

Kendra Ash
Well depending.

Chi Ejimofor
It just really depends. Sure.

Kendra Ash
Um but yeah Yes, that is yes.

Chi Ejimofor
Overall, yeah. And then for invoice and then I guess if they ask for invoices, then you just bill it. Boom send it. All good.

Kendra Ash
And then you you boom quick send it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, you send it in, then the memo is ac more it's like the memo is accurate in general. You write their exact memo. Correct. Yeah. Correct.

Kendra Ash
I don't know if they complain about the invoice or say it's not their service or something then then that's a problem but 'cause that can happen too obviously.

Chi Ejimofor
You know Okay, cool.

Kendra Ash
All right, yeah, that's uh Yeah, for invoicing it's much straighter, more yeah, invoicing it We could just invoice everybody, life would be simple.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Well, yeah. Uh That's interesting. Okay. Do I have I think I that might be I might be uh I guess as a random I'll just catch all. Is there any like any other random thing that you think I guess is there anything that so you're s you're supposed to be billing all the time uh but you get I guess the things that distract uh Uh seeing this the things that distract from directly bullying contracts, contract paperwork, C SIP stuff, um all the lien waivers we get sent that we have
Kendra Ash
to sign what's this uh waivers for getting payments receiving payments um there's there's a bunch of stuff oh a dot stuff where i have to confirm payments Uh there's I don't even know. There's uh things that distract me are a ton. Normally I don't have a s a set schedule of any kind well actually I don't I never do.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Kendra Ash
It's just I just answer I just whatever is an urgent thing that day, I get emails all day long of we need this right now. We need this right now. We need this right now.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you think like whatever an accountant or something that will that take some of the I mean who knows what the an accountant would do, but is that uh accepting payment is that I don't know what I yeah, I don't know what billing is and I don't know what accounting is and I don't know Okay, okay, fair.

Kendra Ash
Well, it's like Don and I both receive payments. So she gets all the checks and then she gets a bunch of EF, you know. what the heck um emails and stuff that you know for what is it electronic payments and then I get a bunch of emails for electronic payments also plus I get Everything that's from Textura that gets billed, those all come to me. And then some from Procor, some from GCP. So all of the payments come through those systems. go direct just go directly to me.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, but that's and that should be like if we had like a an idea of your job that like receiving payments is like billing and then receiving payments is like Yes. And then of course you have to do and then you uh and then you of course contracts like s some level of contract would be something.

Kendra Ash
But now a big part of it is contracts.

Chi Ejimofor
A big part of it is contracts. Okay. Yes.

Kendra Ash
If we don't get contracts done and signed, then we a lot of jobs we can't get onto. So Okay, so and then I'm the only one who does that. the one who signs all the contracts.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Um why don't we just I mean man we'd take a few seconds or minutes uh go through the Well okay, well I guess there okay well I guess uh there's probably there's a contract folder, is there?

Kendra Ash
There's not a contract folder, no. They just go into they go in to QuickBooks.

Chi Ejimofor
Damn. Now I have to get access to QuickBooks. Okay. Uh also all contracts are only in QuickBooks.

Kendra Ash
Or they're on everyone's email sent to the contracts.

Chi Ejimofor
Sure, sure, sure. But as far as like a physical place, there there's no SharePoint No, they're all no just QuickBooks.

Kendra Ash
Unless Jared might have some or I don't know he uses some other
Chi Ejimofor
things that I don't know anything about. Yes, yes, yes.

Kendra Ash
Maybe he puts them somewhere. I have no idea.

Chi Ejimofor
Right. Uh only person okay. Yeah, 'cause I was like, uh, you know, red line just going through I wanted to go through, you know It'll be nice to see well I I've seen a little bit, you know, this is like a this um when we get a new contract.

Kendra Ash
I asked last week a couple of times when I'm getting these contracts should I be calling um T and going through them with him and showing him what's going on for you.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Well for me, um throw me on there. I mean it's good thirty minutes or whatever because I I mean I I need to start seeing Uh, I know according to the big boss, I know he's he was more like for the f I don't think he wants me to take anything for, you know, at least the first month, but I think I mean Especially if it's like thirty m you know, it's like an hour here, thirty minutes, like I mean generally I'm like interviewing people and putting together maps.

Kendra Ash
Some are you know, it just depends.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah, that would be good to just start to that.

Kendra Ash
Whenever we get a contract, I will just let you know and say, Hey, let's just Jump on a call when you get a chance and we'll do that.

Chi Ejimofor
That'll be perfect. Yeah. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Sounds good.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh, okay, cool. Okay. Okay, cool. Well, I'm gonna try to um Put some of this together and then uh I'm gonna you know probably call the IT people and try to or just try to yeah I'm gonna try to call the IT people and see what um First of all, maybe I'll find a computer in the office that has this stuff and just see if I can understand what's going on and and then uh you know, see if I can get this QuickBooks thing set up because that's definitely gonna that's definitely uh you know not being able to see some of that stuff is a hindrance so right there's a lot of information Okay. This is good. Thank you for everything. Yeah, thank you for the time. Uh I know you're crazy busy.

Kendra Ash
Once you put stuff together and if you have any more questions or if you're just even sitting around like you're like hmm what should I do right now if you want to you can call me and I can always just have you watch me go through billing and go through all the change order stuff and how that goes whenever and it's you know whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay.

Kendra Ash
something you know.

Chi Ejimofor
I was gonna say, yeah, just to even 'cause I like I said, I I'm leaning, you know, not allowed to lean anywhere, but I'm leaning more towards like
Kendra Ash
pre pe like a you know PMs being set up so I think you know understanding the swift billing yeah be helpful for you. You know?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah seeing the billing and then seeing also the change order um yes.

Kendra Ash
Yes. The change order process. So yes. So we'll go over some of that. But yeah, I will call I'll let you know when we get some contact.

Chi Ejimofor
I was gonna say how often do you think it means every week? Okay. Okay, so you get a couple contracts a week.

Kendra Ash
How often does this billing we can get ten contracts in a week and But just recently it seems like we just haven't been getting that many.

Chi Ejimofor
And you do okay, well I guess billing is happening. Down just chimed in daily, but change orders w y is that like also kind of daily or Fifty fifty. Hmm Yes, yes. Okay. Uh I guess I'll just pick a I'll just like I'll just uh pick a day. Well, I need to I need to process a lot information. But I think probably Wednesday.

Kendra Ash
But I will let you know when we have contracts and to get those out so those will have to go to retreat. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, we'll start with with just including me on those and then as as we go we'll look we'll talk about billing and change orders, but just contracts for now. Okay.

Kendra Ash
Okay, that works.

Chi Ejimofor
Alright. Have a great rest of the day. Thank you for your time.

Kendra Ash
Alright, thank you.

Chi Ejimofor
All right. Bye.

Kendra Ash
Okay. Bye.
