Chi Ejimofor
I don't trust the Teslas, I will say.

Michael Ricks
I won't I won't the what I own a Tesla. don't use AI or anything.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm not trying to have nobody taking my Can you imagine you miss a payment and they just tell the car, hey, come back real quick. Yeah, you can literally slab it.

Michael Ricks
that point where these electric cars were like literally they could just be like wow let's turn your car off.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Oh you can't drive any further than five miles from your house.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, you piss somebody it came well, not to get to politics, but you piss somebody off, you know, hey, he's in the car, turn it off right now and go go get him. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Just rely on AI.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, well yeah.

Lacie Slevin
It's you'll know nothing, you'll learn nothing, you'll just AI everything. It's like nothing.

Michael Ricks
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
No good.

Michael Ricks
Coming out with the what they call Tesla taxi or something like that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Yeah. It turns into like a way Waymo while you're you can tell your car to go turn into a Waymo whenever you want.

Chi Ejimofor
I want a Waymo I would buy a Waymo. If they were available I'd buy a Waymo. Those are those they work I mean it doesn't take you like you have a limit of like your range, but for in town, I mean the funny video thing where there's a
Michael Ricks
the median and like in the middle of traffic it's like here's your shot you're like what the I don't know about this sometimes they're like in the middle of the road and they're like real confused and I saw that yeah it was like a eight months ago I remember yes there was like
Chi Ejimofor
like a traffic jam down at Tempe caused by these uh it was it wasn't Waymo it was one of the other car ones that was you know
Michael Ricks
Having a glitch.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. But I mean with the way people drive, I'm like, it's driving's gonna be illegal. I don't know if it's gonna be ten years or what, but You know, once it gets to a point where the uh I mean it's already, you know, we still have a while for that, but Taking my dad into it's like fifty I mean it can you cause it's like that's like the highest cause of death and it's not even close. Oh accident. Yeah, it's like fifty K a year, so it's not even close. But uh, you know Anyway, but yeah, you guys uh you guys are out on out in the streets daily. Uh uh you guys are you g you and the old you and uh You and Jared are the only ones who use Monday as far as I'm aware.

Michael Ricks
Well you're saying all of us Yeah, sales and sales and sales and jerk.

Chi Ejimofor
I guess technically as the org chart goes, everybody it's like the operations people are the only ones or this no the sales uh little column is the only one who who you uses Monday. Yep. Uh which I found was interesting because I I looked at Monday and I was like, I mean this is to call it a s to call it a C with respect, to call it a CRM is is uh you know it's a Yeah.

Michael Ricks
It's a notion kind of copy paste or something, if that or Yeah it I think all of us have have voiced that in you know Some way, shape, form, or you know what I mean like Yeah, I don't think it's a CRM by any means.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh and you guys all come f you know you s you all come from s you have a sales background, you had sales jobs before this.

Lacie Slevin
Or is like sales you guys are what's what CRM sales yeah sales force sales force is like the most popular and service titan which I actually think would be a pretty decent fit for this type of business because we Yeah. So I think sir Titan would be sufficient for the size of the business currently.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
And the type of business that we do.

Chi Ejimofor
You so you did use service Titan before? Is there a si what size is it where it and what about it gets weird after a certain size?

Lacie Slevin
Uh the company I was with was seventy-five people. They were a home builder. with camera. Um but you can have your customers do work orders too like they can create work for orders for you. Yeah which is cool Um I didn't work in it a whole lot, but the way that it worked, like it would fit this business. Like it's similar to our type of business. As far as the work orders go.

Chi Ejimofor
Maybe I'll schedule pay-the quoting as well. Yeah. I've been just setting up meetings with random with people seeing Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Seeing my recommended service
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. But the main but for the actual sales Salesforce. And back in the day you guys would like would log all your I guess does this Salesforce uh Whenever you make calls or texts or you know, was it that granular like that you were logging the information and communication or was it more I think you in sales for you can do as little or as much as you want.

Michael Ricks
I know it's expensive, but yeah, state farm state farm white gloved sales force. And yes, we did We had to notate.

Chi Ejimofor
It was like every communicum okay, every communication.

Michael Ricks
Yeah, and it would even link their screen recordings. That was it.

Lacie Slevin
What's your phone number? Do you have a company phone? No.

Chi Ejimofor
Not yet. Um I'll probably Google Voice and just to keep uh I mean I have one, Google Voice, but uh I'm gonna f figure out what to yeah, 'cause I don't think I want uh my personal number to be out on the You know, separ separation church and state. Um they have to give you a phone. Yeah. I mean you can use my personal number now. Uh that's a non-negotiable. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
phone situation here is bananas.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah it seems like direct there's like an automatic there is automat directors automatic you know you phone day one um But yeah, I guess yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Like if I need to reach Don. I have no direct line to them. I have no direct line to unless I have their personal cell phone.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, they have the answer line. Yeah, that's yeah everybody's Yeah, it's like if they use yeah, so they have it for some people. They have it all in fact it is only direct directors all have company phones and only and then I think I guess you guys do as well. Um but then nobody no one else. Um maybe the estimator Uh maybe Jared Do you think what level of I mean if you guys if there was like um well I guess I'll get on yeah, if there was a level of um you guys have been around for a long time, so if there was like l younger like SDR like a lower level of salesperson that was joining, what level of uh activity or what activities would you want to see from them if you if that makes sense. So if you had a sales force and then you were looking at their activities, what would be
Lacie Slevin
You know, cause you guys would probably be the you know, be the I think if I if I had any piece of advice for you or anything that would make our lives is worthwhile. There's no workflow.

Chi Ejimofor
Just workflow in general.

Lacie Slevin
There's no such thing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
Um I had a project yesterday, for example. I was just driving to a job and I look over and I I see Hayden, which is my builder. I see our SWPPP signs. No, I had no idea that job even existed. So I go in there and they have R SWPPP and they need sweeping so I signed him up for that. I come back and I'm like hey Jared there's no project in in Monday for this. He's like well we don't we didn't get it yet. I'm like we sure did our slip is on the site He's like, well, I didn't know that we won that job. I'm cool. So who did? How did we get the slip out there?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
There's no workflow whatsoever.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
There's no follow-up as far as We won the project and then alerting us.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Lacie Slevin
Um, you know, I should be aware of a project as it bids and then when it's won, there just is nothing
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I've seen that. Okay. Uh and for that specifically Did you end up tracking that down? Like I guess probably somebody my guess would be somebody called Jason directly. Probably yeah.

Lacie Slevin
I just had uh Jared fit Mark it as one so I could put it in my top and do it in the middle of the case.

Chi Ejimofor
So okay, so it was like estimated but there was no there's an estimate sent out last yeah. Okay.

Michael Ricks
Pull up to Chipotle, it's like halfway done. Yeah. And there's four desert services roll-ups. Two or concrete ones full. And I walk in and he's like, here you guys can Yes, sir. I don't even know where I'm at right now or and it's the same thing it says not starting. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Wait We're not being informed when we've won the project. Um it would be really nice if it was, you know, like big goes out, like there was a process, big goes out, you know, in the bidding process, bid sent, bid won, bid lost.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I was gonna start I don't know what like a why did we lose it. Yeah, yeah. I was gonna s you know the short term I was going to just be I'm not sales, but like following up on I know it's I have to like figure it out because Rick uh Rick is Supposed to be following up on the bids, and he does to an extent, but if he picks the high dollar ones and then goes after only those. Which is fine, but there's still like literally as far as like the the S there's like three thousand of them in that Monday queue and it's like I don't know no one knows what happened to any of those. And it seems like yeah, I was talking to Kendra yesterday and she said yeah people I was asking uh I it depends on who you ask, but some people thought that we always get a contract. According to Kendra we like get a contract like I don't know. Literally who knows percent of the time. And uh okay, so that's interesting.

Lacie Slevin
The other thing that I we were under the impression Rick was gonna be doing was when a bit is sent out that you someone is following up on it and getting like a PM's name and contact and an address so that then we can't allow make introductions, yep, yep, Excel, do those things. That's not happening. So that would be really nice if we could have that process put in place. Um sometimes the bid's one and it's like just one. I have no idea where the job is. I don't have a PM to call for information. So it's like, great, we won. That's awesome.

Chi Ejimofor
Like so PM or superintendent's name, uh, address, name contact. Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Job site addresses. It's tough too because our entire role is to try to upsell them on the services, right? So if they win a bid that we had no idea about and other services.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
It's uh it's your defense is usually already Up and yeah.

Michael Ricks
Well but once a site is started like if you're going out there and they have already broke ground on that site, fat chance on up selling them on anything. Or or or getting our services on there for you know I mean anything other than SWPPP or what you know, maybe 10 fence if it's already done. Because they've all if they have broke ground and started, PJs are gonna be out there. Fence is up, flip is done. They'll have at least one roll-off dumpster out there. You know what I mean? Like uh to get the site off like it's already done they've already it once the project has started it's too late. The getting the PMs information is something where like literally the minute that we like start bidding on something we should call we should be like that in contact already. That was Rick's role initially was made to be that where as soon as we're starting to bid on these things, as soon as we start hearing about them, as soon as dust permits are pulled, like getting that information early, so then we can call PMs, you know, estimators, whoever, to try and, you know, like start the sales process early enough to get more services out there. So as far as that goes, that I mean that needs to happen. like super early.

Lacie Slevin
And I know Jared a lot of times is like, well they don't send over an address. And like they know where the project is. So
Chi Ejimofor
it's just asking what is this?

Lacie Slevin
And I know he's super busy.

Chi Ejimofor
He's super b the issue is Jared.

Lacie Slevin
Jared like he's overwhelmed.

Chi Ejimofor
If he was if there's three or four Jareds like probably be I mean you could probably just go as is and
Lacie Slevin
So like we've been a project um and there's no address, we should be asking Well, where is this project?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. Okay, so generally h how you guys understand your role, it's m it's it's like it's we have we we estimate something And you make contact and try to get more services on that onto that estimate, something like that.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah. That's ideal.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
What is currently happening is The bid is being put into Monday some of the time.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
It's never marked sometimes it's won' marked one and sometimes it's not. It's just sitting there. uh did we get this, did we not?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
And then there's no contact. So I can't reach out to them and you know I could cold call them, which is absolutely bananas.

Chi Ejimofor
When we have yeah yeah And dust permits especially, like dust permits I have like I we get the contact. I have I have uh all the information because you have to to do the dust permit.

Michael Ricks
Well and the the Dodge um service once we get that rolling will will help us to locate current sites and and get all of our you know all that's the new stuff is what we
Chi Ejimofor
Really need to what is this? What is Dodge? What is that?

Michael Ricks
It's a database of all the builders, like um information, all their job sites, all the you know, it'll give you your address.

Chi Ejimofor
Is that just for like every yeah, what is that?

Michael Ricks
Is that for every builder in like the complete area, whatever? Yeah. Okay. Um and Tim's working on getting us the password. and and all like the account setup and all that stuff on that.

Chi Ejimofor
That'll help us get, you know, that's that's DOD like Dodge like the the vehicle. Dodge database. Okay.

Michael Ricks
Um that'll help us with getting all of our current sites. where we're you know we've got them mapped out we've got everything you know that kind of deal but um but yeah I mean as far as like workflow though like Like I said, I mean for us, our like if I guess if we're I was explaining our role, our job, our you know, what we do on a daily basis, the main thing is relationship building, hitting these job sites. uh trying to you know make contact with as many superintendents, as many PMs, as many you know what I mean, like with these companies so that when they do have a new job coming up, they're calling us before. So for example, like I've got a deal with Chase where no one even knows to be bidding on this new high school that's out there. the PM who's doing it I have been in contact with and he wants us to put together a bid for the you know full project life of the project kind of deal.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Michael Ricks
That's what we need to, you know, that's what we're trying to do So like we're out there visiting job sites doing all that stuff. Um you know like that's our role essentially.

Chi Ejimofor
Like Okay, that makes sense.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, well and we're doing a lot of like problem solving stuff. You know, if someone calls me, we're having an issue with this, we need a sweeper, the water you know, the water That's not whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
So you guys are technic okay, so the actual job is what you just said, but you're actually when I heard what you guys were out doing, I was like, Are these are they project managers or are they like Are they basically extra delivery managers? I was like, this is these are project managers. Why are you know they're not salespeople? But it sounds like you're supposed to actually be doing You're supposed to just be meeting people, getting phone phone numbers, I don't know, calling.

Michael Ricks
Okay, so it's a little bit of that account. Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Michael Ricks
From you're the salesperson, but you're also their main point of contact. Like if you're they're having any issues if they're you know I mean they can call you and you you know take care of the issue.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Michael Ricks
Um and then you know I've got another big site where for example like I go out every Tuesday morning for the foreman's meeting and this is a big one where we've got like the at-risk bid we're doing the life of the project all of our side services the whole deal so it's a little bit more of like a uh white glove That's like Clayco is yeah.

Lacie Slevin
We have all s all of their services, all seven are with us, including some services we've never even offered before. So I go every Monday and I meet with them and then I am their point of contact for everything.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
So I spend a lot of time at the job side, but Yes, we've got to do that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so there is like there's kind of like a s it's a it's a two part system. It's a little bit of there's a there's a project management element, especially for the big projects where and when say big it's like when we're literally offering our full suite. Yeah. And then there's a more of a sales aspect when it's like they just wanted whatever we estimated and you're just trying to get online for other stuff. Yeah. Um how do you manage uh your do you use Monday I mean, how do you manage like your the I w your own work from a like the project management side, I guess if you will? So like 'cause you have you so use Monday for okay, and I was gonna say I don't understand I I haven't sat down with the person who who did did the Monday thing, but I don't understand the sales um
Lacie Slevin
We have a list of our top eighty.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
Um and then we have to go to those sites once a month.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
Do an inspection report every time we're out there, which shows what services you know what they're who they're using for each service how that service is going there's a place for notes um that kind of stuff which is where we notate like they need
Michael Ricks
This fixed or one more and then reporting all that.

Chi Ejimofor
So I see okay, so I see a Brandon top eighty, I see you Lacey top. I guess that's your top Eighty or something. And I see a SWPPP project. You both have SWPPP projects. And there's nothing in there, I guess.

Lacie Slevin
What it was was initially we had no sales force we had no CRM yeah so we took the SWPPP um the list of SWIPS for each inspector and And then we were territory based. And so we uploaded all of their SWIPT projects. And then we went out to the, I had to like find addresses for those. move them over into Monday so we used that to build our top 80 but at this point we don't need that anymore.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
Um it's just in there. I mean we can technically get rid of it at this point
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So those two imagine they don't exist. Mike Top Projects is top 80 or top whatever amount as well.

Lacie Slevin
Um I see a new project section which is new projects is that one where I so technically when Jared moves them over into new projects and then he should be marking them bid one.

Chi Ejimofor
So if he marks a bid one maybe the automation will check, but like if we marks a bid one it should go into there.

Lacie Slevin
Well, I think it I don't know when it goes in there, right? But then he marks it bid one and then we have to go in there and see whose G C is this and we assign it to ourselves. I would love the automation to say this is hate
Michael Ricks
I think it could though. Ideally, it's no problem with the
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, that makes sense. And then project opportunities technically might be, you know, that is hands.

Lacie Slevin
So we've created that because
Michael Ricks
Oh, you're just seeing sites and Mike got hired. We we we kind of like started that because it would be one where it's like, hey, this isn't part of my top 80, but I I saw this site over here.

Lacie Slevin
Let me pop I want to pop in there.

Michael Ricks
Even if we didn't have anything on there like at all. I'm not gonna put that on my top 80 because it's not something I need to visit every single month. But it's a project opportunity. I'm going in, I'm still talking about Superintendent um trying to build that relationship so on their next job site. So that's the thing.

Chi Ejimofor
So top eighty is really like okay, these are the ones you said you're going every week. And then everything else is just not in the top. And these are sites, not
Lacie Slevin
But ideally the way it should work in what I'm used to is you start with a builder and then the builder has leads and then the builder Builder has projects and the builder has job sites. You know what I mean? There's a flow.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
So that I everything I do is based off the customer. When I create a project
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
That's not the way it works right now.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so even the It's not driven by the organization of the of the Monday is not by this, it's just no kind of just they just sa it looks yeah just projects.

Lacie Slevin
I should be able to go into Hayden's account and see all of their projects. And all of their leads.

Michael Ricks
My I was just saying Monday doesn't do that, so uh uh unless we switch, we can't expect that. We just have to do that. No, I know, I'm just saying that's yeah.

Lacie Slevin
workflow for sales process should go. Everything should be off of the account. And then I should be able to go in Hayden and see all of their projects, all of their you know, all the leads we have for them. Upcoming projects, current projects, past project, everything should be in their account.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Right now it's not.

Michael Ricks
See like this is what we are actually doing at that job site and my head's not cut off and I'm not talking to you like I have no idea what we're doing.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay
Lacie Slevin
Right now you have to go into an inspection report to see for that project to see what services we're doing when really it should sit in projects like we should know. we see all the projects for that account and which services we have on each project. So they're it's like we we're living in two different sections of Monday
Michael Ricks
Like for me all my job sites have never been visited. So I'm going out there for the most part for the first time. And I often have no idea what we're even doing there. different people to try and figure out what we're doing there.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
So then I just go myself and I just try to look. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
That's the other thing is each business each business line runs Separately.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
They don't talk to each other. Like sweeping doesn't know if water trucks is there.

Chi Ejimofor
You know what I mean?

Lacie Slevin
Crazy.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I was gonna say that's what yeah I was seeing that there's yeah there's I thought it was wild that yeah the s sweeper guy sweeper guy's the wildest with with the with the paper and pencil. He just writes it down. But sweeper guy get a call and and he's just sending somebody out there and nobody else knows until he sends a pig picture of his thing. Yeah, it's just yeah no one knows until the end of the week when he sends a Kelly.

Michael Ricks
That's what Kelly does everything on a piece of paper?

Lacie Slevin
Yeah. Yeah, and then sends it to Dom. And she has to manually enter all this. It's great. It's great.

Michael Ricks
That is not even here. That's why.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. We're working. We're working on it. I we're we're we're we're think we're figuring out what what the what what the whole thing looks like. I mean Yeah, the the OG guys, I mean they do I guess they do good w you know, make they make money, but then yeah, there's no best that they could with what they have. Right.

Lacie Slevin
But we're getting to a
Chi Ejimofor
It's starting to yeah, you st start to see the fractures. And if if the all the if everything's gonna be under one roof makes sense, like you guys should know s if he's sending a sweeper to your site, you know. You should know m you know, not not a week later or something. like that.

Lacie Slevin
Well and a lot of times like for him especially or for when we first started when I first started I was going out there and you know I can see some of the obviously I I can see fence, I can see showers, I can see Portojons. But for sweeping and for water trucks, I don't know if we're doing that or someone else's. And so I'm going in there and it looks silly. You know, it's like
Michael Ricks
Yeah, every time I've been like, I think we're doing sweep here, are we coming out for inspections? And they're like, no, not inspections, but you're sweeping out here. I have no idea.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah. Yeah, it's just a bad book.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And uh s and Salesforce for example, Salesforce does have that level of organization from the builder to the you know to the project and down as far as like actual I guess day to day stuff for a project how how m I guess it it yeah how would it work in there Or if you had to if you were able to like hey buying Salesforce tomorrow, this is how we would organize ourselves within there, would it connect to Monday or would it be yeah, how would you need Monday? Okay. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
I think Service Titan would be nice because you can do your invoices and you can do everything from Service Titan.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
Um you can do filling, you can do I think another thing we need to be logging and I've mentioned this before is um so in Salesforce there's a thing called cases so let's say someone calls and says you're
Chi Ejimofor
sweeper didn't show up today.

Lacie Slevin
We log it as a case.

Chi Ejimofor
So then you can go back in and pull up your cases for the month and be like where are we sailing?

Lacie Slevin
Why are we having sweepers not showing up you know 17 times this month? And then you can take those and address it with the Sweet D. Um that we're not doing that currently. So like as things come up, they're just they're issues, you fix it, and that's the end of it.

Chi Ejimofor
And then there's and then it happens again next week.

Lacie Slevin
week you know so track being able to track when we're not meeting the mark is something I think we're lacking.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay Okay, so there's none okay. That's that would be big.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
I mean it's like I just lost Portigons on a project, a big project for me. Because they were missing filling the trailers. But it's something I brought up to the water division multiple times.

Chi Ejimofor
And now you know what?

Lacie Slevin
But there's nothing You know, there's no record of that other than me calling and saying, Hey, you missed this again. That's not enough.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. It has to be able to go somewhere. Okay Okay.

Michael Ricks
I think I mean Salesforce would be sweet, but Salesforce is expensive.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
HubSpot is like probably the second biggest
Chi Ejimofor
They have a big free well, for uh we would we would fill the free tier in two minutes, but uh as far as I'm aware. But okay. Okay. What do you want I guess so that the what do you want to do in what do you want your uh CRM to be able to do on a high level? Organized it was like she said by building so organized the the hierarchy as far as projects to Uh build project to manage a customer. Manage a customer. And in every department too.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah. If it could bring all of it into one place instead of having five different systems. I think service Titan would be good for that.

Chi Ejimofor
I'll look into that one and schedule something with them and see what they what they do.

Michael Ricks
Cheaper. I mean cheaper than HubSpot's and Salesforce for sure.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Michael Ricks
So whenever you guys I mean the way that I see it, like we're to make things Easier on us.

Chi Ejimofor
Sure, yeah.

Michael Ricks
Like right now, Monday for me and what I'm doing like on a daily basis, the most important thing like honestly is the maps which doesn't work.

Chi Ejimofor
Which doesn't doesn't work very well.

Lacie Slevin
I don't know if Salesforce has Salesforce has a great map. I'm not super familiar with if there's a mapping thing on Service Titan, so we got to get into that.

Michael Ricks
I mean I I would assume if it's gonna work better for us and there's not a map system Logan I think pays like ten bucks.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah we just I looked at his thing. Yeah compliance go.

Michael Ricks
It's four yeah yeah. Uh I couldn't remember the name of it but he pays like ten bucks a month for it he can put it in there and it'll literally like he can it takes some time to get it organized the way that you want it but like you can have it where like your entire month day by day by day is set up where like the are what I hit these days. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like and it and then you go to that day, boom, that's on the map, you hit those sites, you're good. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
I mean the other thing though is like when I go out, like let's say I get a call and I have to go to a job site and it's not my new typical day for that job site or whatever. When I'm there I want to hit all of the job sites in that area. I'm already over there right and so I should be able to pull the map and it shows all of my projects
Michael Ricks
Yeah, our map has been kind of funky as of late. It was working much better, but then when we added my The amount it just to it started doing a weird thing and I think it's because we don't have separate sales dashboards of which we're now we're or project dashboards now we're working on I think getting that set up but the issue was we didn't have separate dashboards so like he'd go in change the filter to like look at his jobs I'd go back in to see my jobs and it was now looking at his jobs.

Chi Ejimofor
You know what I mean?

Michael Ricks
Like so everybody was kind of piggybacking off of each other and every time you'd go in to try and look at your maps. So it was kind of getting wonky but I think we're gonna
Chi Ejimofor
get that figured out but that's with the Tevin Tevin guy.

Michael Ricks
Mm-hmm.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So you guys work with him directly? Mm-hmm.

Michael Ricks
Yeah. Okay. Um But so like maps is the most important thing and we can get that figured out outside of a sales system.

Chi Ejimofor
You know what I mean? Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Um but then I think something that would make life easier is if so right now the process of I walk into a place they say hey I wanna get whatever I want to switch my dumps to you guys. If if within all of us using and when I say all of us not just sales like all of us like Jason and everybody would be on this new system if it's possible um I can go into that system under that account and like essentially kind of put in like hey we need five dumpsters on this boom and you know that gets relayed to JSON. You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Because right now it's we need this.

Michael Ricks
Okay. Then I go to my email, I type an email, I've got to add the client. They've got to confirm and I'm sending that to Jason that you know I mean it's like I don't know if it could be put in one place I guess but it does so like I this is service Titan and it says there's a project planned and in that one project there's all these things listed and you can do change orders or you can add like notes where they where This job meets these things. There's gotta be a way. And I mean uh like I said. I've been under the impression that right now Monday is what Tim wants to like roll with and and it's cheap.

Chi Ejimofor
It's cheap and it and it wor and it does uh work to and it and the the theoretical it is capable of of Anything. It's you know, Jack of all, like master of none and not not really comp super competent in in even one, but it's more like it can do a lot. And theoretically, if you organized it If you organize it a certain way, it could have everything in it.

Michael Ricks
Monday's like appeal is too is you can I mean build it almost
Chi Ejimofor
Like a lot of these are it's almost like a a no code app in in a way or no clo no code thing where you can kinda build it the way they want to build it.

Michael Ricks
It's just gonna take time to get it to that point. So I mean honestly at this point like I think everybody's voice you know maybe a different one would be better but I think right now is Monday is what we have and we need to figure out how to make it work but the biggest problem is for us I mean you know I would say what does Monday's biggest con is that it it's not like very integratable with all those other departments.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Which that causes a big bottleneck. for a lot of stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I think even just short term, even if I you know even if even with me just hopping in and grabbing starting to grab stuff I think that was supposed to be my role. Even I mean i even if I don't uh streamline or fix anything, like at the very minimum Greasing the wheel and just gr you know putting things together at least even personally and being like, hey guys, what's going on here? And just being annoying on certain things. Um but yeah, starting to bring everything together. Um because there's no project manager or project, you know, which I guess that's Um, I don't think that's what they envisioned for the project coordinator. They thought it would be more just like pay your middle guy between uh estimates, contracts, and then And then the yeah, sales at the end. But now I'm hearing it's like there's probably a more of a keeping track of there's probably more of a being a middleman overall, uh until there is a Until there is a system better a system to like, you know uh 'cause you gotta yeah, I'm seeing 'cause I you know, uh some of these Excel files, you know, it's gonna take It's gonna take a long time to adjust to anything other than the Excel files. So it's like short term I'm like okay we just gotta figure out how to how to maybe we can't get rid of the Excel files Just yet, but it's like I can at least be able to communic yeah, I can get stuff to that guy who's using his Excel file and he's you know, that's just just I'm viewing it as as his personal magical way of of managing it. The writing the the notebook is cooked. The notebook is we're gonna have to that's that's unacceptable to me. But everything else that I've seen so far it's like probably I can work with that thing and they just have that personal way of working. And and then, you know, uh we can just communicate with them from the outside.

Michael Ricks
They don't need to use Monday necessarily, but you know, it needs to be like from a workflow standpoint, should we
Chi Ejimofor
Right now, like to kind of start this process, and we'll have to probably have a couple more of these meetings and what's working, what's not right?

Michael Ricks
Like, but should we create Uh so we've got you know like a sales email right now, you know, where the the sales emails go into and everybody can kind of see it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Michael Ricks
Should we have maybe like an email thread that's sales just to you with all of us in there and then if we're getting stuff we're flowing you know what I mean like taking it to I think
Lacie Slevin
we're trying to separate things a bit because right now it's like everything for all of us is common which is And you guys are seeing I've seen I've used sales email or if we have an email, another email, it's like I have to go in there and say, Oh, this is brand.

Michael Ricks
Oh, no, but I'm saying I don't wanna what I'm saying with that is like a sales email to you where like if I'm out I so I don't know how how we're trying to make this look. Are we trying to make it look like I'm out of sight and I get them to switch over to our dumpsters? Am I still just saying okay I'm gonna call directly to the that director and get that set up or is it funneling to you and then you're funneling out like I don't know how that's supposed to be.

Chi Ejimofor
It's and there's not an answer to that, but but that is part of what, you know, in the next two week well, in the next two weeks they you know, they're looking for kind of a They wanted to I'm look I'm putting together kind of an as is understanding. This is what's happening right now. And then as part of that, I'm like, this is you know Maybe this is the vision. I don't even know if I can put together a vision for the future. It's like the next steps I'm looking at are probably it's probably more like that where it's you know it's somebody is collecting information and organizing it and and then dis and disseminating it as needed to whoever needs to be involved but that person's also keeping track of it so they're not It's not like, hey, also we need an issues log. That's sounds like a big thing. But it's like somebody's keeping track of it so it's not just lost. It you know, not one person knows about it. There's a dashboard, there's a there's a overall look.

Lacie Slevin
gonna happen you know from day one is when the bids are going out that someone's following up with those and giving PMs and addresses and then and then funneling them to us So that we can then start the process with that restaurant.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
That's not happening. And so we're a lot of times not finding out. I mean, I didn't find out about the Haven job They're already fucking building.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
It's insane.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's what I was 'cause then that would solve it seems like that would solve also the other thing where they where we're getting uh it sounds like we're getting like hints of getting the job. Hey, you might, you know, and then we're starting to do stuff, but we didn't get a contract yet. It sounds like that might speed up that piece. where it's like we need a contract by the way and then you know also get you guys out there and upsell.

Michael Ricks
And again, but yeah in service titan was there a spot where you could put issues but then also is there a spot where you could put like this job needs this added to it almost like a change order that would then notify someone else or Yeah, I believe so.

Lacie Slevin
They do a lot of it's all kind of work order based. So like to do a work order every time you have to go out and fix the fence or you know what I mean? It's but it would trap all your different varies business. I worked in service titan very minimally. Um but I liked the way that it worked as far as like sending a crew out and having a log of that work order. Um, so I mean you should meet with them and get more information.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I'll talk with them.

Lacie Slevin
Um I don't know a lot about sales and service Titan. I just know a lot about like work orders and then you know tracking those kinds of things.

Michael Ricks
So I have a hot rep too if you're rolling to that time.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh you do? Okay. What's a tag? Okay. So we'll I'll I'll talk with them. Hate those some of these you know what I just like about the sales meetings? It's is that they have uh not that this stuff is technical, but they'll they have this uh some Um a kid on the phone with me who doesn't know the software, you know, is just talking to me in this general term and I'm like, I was very specific in my inquiry and um, you know, and they have some person and I'm like Man, this is a waste of time.

Lacie Slevin
Just give me Well they don't know your business. So you have to you need to know our business before you go to that this, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
So no, yeah, that's all so that's part of the game, but I'm like, uh, you know. Give me the give me the give me the adult. Give me the killer, okay? But anyway, it's all good.

Michael Ricks
Okay, so that's that's uh
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I'm like, just set me up with the person who can just answer from the beginning. I'm talking to a 19-year-old. I'm like, nah man, I'm not I'm not doing this. But I get it. Okay. Uh okay. So you guys more account managers and then Hammonds is just out in the streets doing
Michael Ricks
He's going after new business.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Just finding new stuff.

Michael Ricks
Well he's fine he's he's trying to go after builders that were not actively like we may have done projects with them but we're not actively
Lacie Slevin
like you know on their sites on a regular basis right so ones that we haven't worked with or ones that we've never worked with. Well once he gets those that's another thing we haven't identified we haven't really identified. Is he gonna Transfer those to one of us? No.

Michael Ricks
Then once he gets those, they'll start becoming his his books.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, his yeah.

Michael Ricks
And then so I mean The role will be the same. The role essentially is gonna evolve in what we're doing. Um and then at that point I don't know if you know We're gonna hire somebody that just goes after new business and it does filter to us.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
But his role is gonna evolve to where we're at. And then maybe maybe it just opens up where we can still go out. out and hunt new new ones as well. But right now, like we've got our list, he's going out hunting, but when he gets one, it's not like he's gonna hand those to us.

Lacie Slevin
But he he does send us like if he s
Chi Ejimofor
Our site of of that based off the big company, right?

Lacie Slevin
So now it's like I'm having to go out and find out where all of Hayden's projects are so that I can manage those projects. And so he's sending those to us, like if it's one of our builders. But and if I'm
Chi Ejimofor
Do those builders I mean I don't know how how you can be with them, but are will they hey what do what else do you have going on? Will they answer questions like that?

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, we're trying to do
Michael Ricks
Yeah. I mean I ask a lot of my especially as the site is like progressing and it I can tell it's getting pretty close. I'll always ask like, hey, where are you going next?

Chi Ejimofor
Oh where are you literally like what uh when it's when it's starting to finish you maybe yeah I'm saying
Michael Ricks
Like when it's starting to finish, where are you headed next as far as like what you know, like what jobs like you guys got coming up? Like, do you already know where you're going? Unfortunately for superintendents with some companies, some are different, like where they've got a pipeline and they know like yeah ahead of time but some of the superintendents they're like I don't know they'll tell me you know a week before I leave here and they just have to go you know what I mean so um But yeah, I mean they'll if they know they'll tell you.

Lacie Slevin
But like and again it's like say we have Hayden, right? We should have a list of their estimators and their phone numbers, their PMs and their phone numbers, all those things so like I'm not calling up just like blindly being like hey I'd love to sit at lunch and learn I have no idea who to speak to like so that getting mad information would be super helpful.

Chi Ejimofor
And have and then it's organized by by the by the book. Okay.

Michael Ricks
Which through Dodge it sounds like we'll be able to do a decent amount of that. But then where will we put it?

Lacie Slevin
But then where do we put it?

Michael Ricks
account you can just go in and look up Hayden and then be like okay I'm gonna call so and so yeah it's like the top top contacts of Hayden that we we already could see and then
Chi Ejimofor
So this Dodge it has just the G does it does it filter down like all the way so we we'll somehow be able to see what projects we're on in that system.

Michael Ricks
No, no, but but I can go in for example like Chase is one of my builders I can go in and look up Chase and it'll show all their projects and then you can open it up and it'll have the address it'll have you know contact info, at least what they were able to gather and they update uh when we did that uh call with them, it updates like every so often so like um and it's not updated it's not automated it's actual people going in and updating the
Chi Ejimofor
Uh looks sick, yeah.

Michael Ricks
So it'll have maybe a PM and a super or whatever, but it'll have some contact information It has the address, you know, so we'll be able to look up right now. I can't, there's no way for me to look up all of Chase's active sites. I can maybe go to their office and sit down with them and say, hey, can you you give me all your active sites, but um Dodge will do that for us, which will be that'll be a good resource.

Chi Ejimofor
But that's only for active sites. It's just a huge initially right now like Dodge is gonna be huge.

Michael Ricks
In a month from now, Dodge isn't gonna be useful as useful to me. or us because we're gonna know all their active sites and then the idea uh moving forward is if I know all of their active sites and I've got contacts with all their supers and like I I should know about their projects company.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, we should be spending more time building relationships and less time trying to track down contacts and, you know, find a job site and get
Chi Ejimofor
an address and so there's an initial so there's like there's an initial push because you guys don't have all the sites and or all the contacts. And then for new people, if there are new people in the future, there are there's a there'll be an initial thing with them even for finding work or whatever it is. But then once you build it up, you're supposed to be
Michael Ricks
No, it's your new child and you're supposed to be you know taking it into the future. The idea is, you know, I mean ideal situation is that you've built the relationship with that
Lacie Slevin
that builder and moving forward like they come to you and they're kind of coming to you.

Michael Ricks
Like you know about the projects you've got you know relationships with the supers and all that stuff. So uh And I mean that'll take time.

Chi Ejimofor
I've I've only been here six months. Yeah.

Michael Ricks
I've got some builders where great relationship with them. I've got some builders where it's like You know, they could start something next week and I probably wouldn't fucking know that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
You know, like um it's just time work yeah, it takes time and working towards it, but Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Rick mentioned something about dust permits where where we we know all the we can see all the dust permits that get Finalized, which means that there's work on there. Um he said that that was a potential thing to like follow up on. Like those are because those are gonna be extra sites. Is that something for him only? Have you guys heard about this? Have you guys heard about it? Okay.

Lacie Slevin
So really so much of going into the dust permits and saying, oh look like
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so if one of your one of those names comes up and send that to us with a contact name, the all the information you can give us, right?

Lacie Slevin
And then we would reach out to them.

Michael Ricks
be like hey I saw you're starting the project you know you found the best current for this we'd love to help you out with these services but it sounds like is doing that and uh Not for the sort of thing. Yeah, he follows through with the sale process.

Chi Ejimofor
kind of zone in on exact like what you know what do you actually have time to do.

Michael Ricks
Yeah, well so just to give you kind of a a background of that role. So like before Rick stepped in to do that role. The role, the the idea for that role was it's an entry-level position.

Chi Ejimofor
When I heard it, I was like, this is a SDR. This is like a somebody who's getting I don't know how much, but they're getting paid 50 grand a year or something, and they're just calling up these people. Twenty a day and you're getting five. Yeah. Entry level position that uh is who gets data.

Michael Ricks
Yeah, they call and they they're essentially like uh you know bird dog for us sending an appointment on sale for us yeah but and not even sending an appointment uh all we All we need is for them to they can look at dust permits, they can, you know, um call on bids that we've sent out, they can, you know, that kind of stuff. As soon as they get a confirmation. that this builder has won that job and that they're moving forward with it. As soon as they get that, they're asking two to three questions.

Lacie Slevin
Where is the project? Who's the PM? Yeah, this is the start.

Michael Ricks
Who's the PM? What's the the project like address? Like you know, where where is it located? And if they don't have a PM already assigned, well, who you know who can we contact about this? Whether it's an estimator or you know, wherever it's at in the process, just getting a contact. contact for it. That was the entire thing for that role. Rick stepped in to see if the role was gonna be like worth having kind of deal and maybe try to start building that out.

Chi Ejimofor
But because Rick is like
Michael Ricks
like sales driven.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah.

Michael Ricks
He kind of just was like boom and started, you know, doing it. We've kind of talked about it and um like uh had conversations and um You know, Rick just said he's like, yeah, I mean essentially I'm what I'm doing right now is just trying to make sure that the role like works and is gonna you know provide you guys with what you need kind of deal, I guess. Um I don't know how long Rick will be in that role, but that's the that's the idea behind that position.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Is for them to provide us with the information to then go and sell.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I'll probably work I'll probably work with him a little bit because I as I see the um yeah coordinator thing Yeah, there's gonna be like after the contract, but then there's also a before the contract and the before the contract is way too muddy and not clear.

Lacie Slevin
I mean once we've got the contract like that's all well and good, but we should really be trying to go after all these services before we get the contract.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
And we're just like half the time we're not even finding out about the job.

Michael Ricks
Well not even necessarily until you drive past it. Not even necessarily before we get the contract. Because like the process and how the builders do it is their s like their estimators send us an invite to bid on the product. That doesn't mean that that builder has won.

Chi Ejimofor
Correct.

Michael Ricks
We we send that then we find out that they won and we get the contract to do the switch.

Lacie Slevin
No, but we swiped don't get the contract. We need to find out when that Builder has won the project. Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Not when we get the contract.

Lacie Slevin
We need to know oh Hayden won this. Now we're going after it. Because we don't always get the swift.

Michael Ricks
Well, we don't always.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I want to know that Hayden won the job. Sure. That's what I need to be. Yeah.

Michael Ricks
But I'm saying even like even if we're not perfect on that and we find out like exactly when we get awards That is still usually early enough for us to get in there and sell PJ's because the first thing that is is done is temp fence and script.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Michael Ricks
Then it gets passed on to a PM and the PM or super started coordinating on who they're going to use. on what super what company what yeah whatever like that.

Lacie Slevin
But if I know that Hayden won that project, I can call them and try and get tendery funds. I can tr call you know, because yeah we we do get a lot of SWPPP But they've then they're going other places for their feds.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
So I want to know like Hayden won this project, I need to call them and try and sell them feds.

Chi Ejimofor
From the job And do we do discount stuff if for bund like services?

Lacie Slevin
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Or is it just is it more just like hey you're by you're using us for this, just like let's go ahead and it needs to be.

Lacie Slevin
The more services you use the bigger discount you get. Yeah. So we have we haven't put that into place necessarily. We're bidding job by job. So that does happen sometimes.

Chi Ejimofor
But Rick was saying that we need a discount to get something done.

Michael Ricks
we can typically but the last sales meeting or maybe two sales meetings ago Tim was saying that he wants to kind of put together like and get us at least a template of of okay on all of these services you can move just in general just so you have the leeway you don't have to have some percentages that you can move to like if it goes outside of the Please then have a conversation with me. If it's within those, do your favorite.

Chi Ejimofor
But yes, we all talked about though.

Lacie Slevin
I mean if you're gonna use one service, right? You just get our basic pricing. If you're gonna do all seven services, you should get a discount. Yeah, that's me. That doesn't make sense that you wouldn't.

Michael Ricks
Yeah. So I don't know if it happens all the time either, but I've noticed that Jared will send an estimate to people asking for an estimate of the difference
Chi Ejimofor
With a different bill, what does that mean?

Michael Ricks
Like he'll send an estimate to Layton and then I'll have Sotela ask for the same estimate And he'll just send Leighton's estimate. And I if I was Sunella I'd be like, what the heck?

Chi Ejimofor
It has Leighton's name on it? Oh.

Michael Ricks
And I I saw it one time and I asked him is this okay? Hey, and he had already said he's like, yeah, it's totally fine.

Lacie Slevin
No, it's not.

Michael Ricks
But also if we start discounting prices for certain builders, like people should feel like that's for them.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah.

Michael Ricks
You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah that's yeah that's uh yeah see he he usu he he usually uh what copy copies uh an existing estimate and changes stuff. But the issue with that sometimes you forget. Yeah. If you do it enough, you know I have it's easy enough to forget.

Lacie Slevin
that's that was just a mistake and it shouldn't happen. Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So that would be better to use templates rather than copy uh copying and changing templates versus further
Michael Ricks
that um didn't Tim also just say that he wants us to ask our GCs if they want a year or annual pricing, which that would obviously affect it as well. But then they're basically just on the count with this. Yeah so like Chase uh they do like they'll do their like do they do it annually?

Lacie Slevin
That's adding a lot of work to be honest to Jared because then he has to go in and find out who's on which contract and you know what I mean, what pricing they're at.

Chi Ejimofor
Like he needs Is that like an annual cut sheet more just like hey if you sign on for a contract or like exclusive?

Michael Ricks
Builders essentially will do like their like annual like I don't know if it's annual or maybe every two years or whatever they do their two year two-year pricing um kind of deal. So like with Chase, I've got a meeting set up with them. We'll go and do a lunch and learn. you know, do all that stuff and then we give them, hey, here's our pricing, you know, like and that gets uh kind of like locked in for two years.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Michael Ricks
I guess Tim was saying maybe we do it where like we tell them, hey We'll lock this price in for a year and then it'll go up by three percent or four percent.

Lacie Slevin
Basically so that estimators don't have to request an estimate necessarily, they just know our pricing and they can plug and play. Then takes step off of dirt, like ultimately.

Michael Ricks
Um so if if we can start getting more of that set up and and it's essentially like a preferred vendors They all have that. Yeah. They have a list of like five vendors that they'll use.

Lacie Slevin
And if they have your numbers, then they don't have to call you for an estimate which makes their life easier and they can just
Chi Ejimofor
Uh and then I asked Rick this probably one of the last questions. Uh in your you've been doing the surveys, you've been doing a lot, is there why do we not win or why do we lose? Or why do we not get work in general, just in your Usually it's two things.

Lacie Slevin
It's either price.

Chi Ejimofor
It is price.

Lacie Slevin
Okay. It's price or it's relationships.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. It's one of the two things.

Lacie Slevin
Like they are a relationship with with say waste management and they get tickets to the Phoenix Open. That's a reason or or they get a better price from someone else
Chi Ejimofor
And because Rick was saying it it wouldn't be about price, but you're saying it's about price.

Michael Ricks
I was gonna say I've had multiple like we And we just did a price increase, which I don't know if it was the right timing to do that because again, she's only been here what eight months? I've only been here six months. months.

Chi Ejimofor
So you're doing you're you're basically just starting and you're like, by the way, like it's more money.

Michael Ricks
positions as a whole to really get a clear picture of like where the competitors at the end.

Lacie Slevin
Well but not not just that.

Michael Ricks
I mean they did the they he hired a company didn't he pricing, like you know what I mean, the competitors pricing and all that stuff. But to see, okay, how how are we really affecting sales? Like are we growing?

Chi Ejimofor
Are we doing these things? Yep.

Michael Ricks
Given enough time to to get a clear picture of like, wow, we we're seeing, you know, like these strides.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Michael Ricks
Whereas now like if you implement a price increase right in the middle of it, like yeah, well who know is it us? Is it the price?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I mean I'm confident but I'm just saying that's a good idea. I don't know because we don't have enough data like to really so what's what are the I mean how how close are we on is it or I mean is it five percent?

Lacie Slevin
is just rock bottom on fence.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean it's a it like twenty five cents is pretty shit, but twenty five cents a linear foot with no install. We can't confuse that.

Lacie Slevin
Twenty five cents okay. I mean pricing is absolutely Absolutely an issue. Not for everybody like Clayco. They call me all the time. They do not give a shit.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
They're just like, we'll pay for it.

Chi Ejimofor
Just do it.

Lacie Slevin
They don't care. But then there's other companies that Very much care. So price is always gonna be on the table. Always. And then relationships.

Chi Ejimofor
Can we Okay. And s so for those where they're buying the the fence from somebody else, can we install it? Or install what? Install the fence. Is that usually it's it comes installed. Okay, okay. That's part of
Michael Ricks
They're not.

Chi Ejimofor
They're just not charging for uh so you're bas they're literally ba for all intents and purposes, they're not charging for fence. They're just charging for labor.

Lacie Slevin
They're charging twenty-five cents a linear foot per month to rent They don't charge you to come out to install it, those kinds of things. There are other things built in sometimes if they you know like if we're linear for Yeah. I mean it was what are we charging? What's the yeah it's a dollar thirty five year foot?

Michael Ricks
To rent it. To rent it. Sometimes a free install.

Lacie Slevin
Sometimes they're not doing twenty-five cents.

Michael Ricks
No way.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah on this one it was like they it was something crazy. They may have done something yeah out of the while just to get it.

Michael Ricks
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
But they're but that's not their normal person. Yeah.

Michael Ricks
They go out of it. How often does it actually
Lacie Slevin
Well it just happened to me it doesn't matter. Um I've only had it happen two or three times.

Michael Ricks
in the nine months but still it's a the only one that I've lost on any of my sites so far is roll off I've lost roll off roll off seems to be a major pain point for people with us No, it's it is the main thing is it's not the like price to dump, it's not any of that. It's the fact that if it sits for over whatever it is twenty eight five days or something and they haven't moved it, we charge a fee. It's like twenty-five dollars a day. So if they go past twenty-five days and they're at like forty days It's twenty twenty-five dollars a day and then they can dump it and it's our regular price plus the twenty-five dollars a day. Like the time over general. I shouldn't say nobody because Tim's like no other people charge it. But I know for a fact that like I believe Weinberger and a few of them that we've gotten replaced with are not charging. it because that's the reason why we got like a switch yeah which Weinberger is pretty well yeah I think I believe they just purchased premiere as well race connection is I did not realize how big the wheel skin is. Like they're fucking huge. I drove by their their like yard their yard. They have they essentially have like a big ass dump station like looks like oh driving out to the like city dump place
Chi Ejimofor
So we we're charging an we're char we're charging a fee for them if we if they don't move the roll off, what's that mean?

Lacie Slevin
If they don't dump it if they don't dump it.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, if they don't request us to come out and dump it then we're charging
Michael Ricks
So like our roll off isn't we we're not charging a monthly fee for them to to have the roll off what it is is like we're charging when we come And dump it every time we need to dump it. Some sites, they need it dumped every two to three days. You know, like they're they're turning burning. But some, like, and depending on the stages that you're at within construction, later you know, early on you're not dumping as much. Like late in the process, they still need a dumpster, they still need a dumpster there, but they're not dumping as much. So like they could go 30 days. easy without dumping sometimes and we start charging like the daily overage of twenty five bucks a day and I guess one of the things is like
Chi Ejimofor
Tim does not have a visibility on how many projects we are losing or n winning based on this specific thing. Like if it was literally somewhere like hey boom like you can just literally look at all these projects All these roll-offs are not ours because these one or like this these roll-offs are not ours because of this reason.

Lacie Slevin
It is won, right? Or or lost. Finding out why we lost it. We we don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
Or lost, yeah.

Lacie Slevin
We don't know why. I mean, other than like what we hear out in the field.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
So but prices on
Chi Ejimofor
hundred percent always gonna be a reason to use and if we lost as far as if if we had a SDR if I was just calling these guys real quick and then they say we lost Is that like something where I would still get you would you would prefer I still get the PM, the address and stuff and then you guys would prefer to go out and get that information in person? Yeah, because just because we lost the Switch right which is all we're really quoting doesn't think of the other stuff.

Lacie Slevin
That's why it would be really nice to know when Hayden's bidding a job. Then let me know and I will then I'll go out and try and get that business and you know what I mean? I need to know that they're like bidding it.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Lacie Slevin
Not I wanna know I wanna know when they want it.

Michael Ricks
If if if we find out when they're bidding, like Chase, Hayden, the big boys shit.

Lacie Slevin
Not when we've won it. Yeah. Okay.

Michael Ricks
'Cause I was gonna say if we're finding out when they're bidding on jobs, we'll be run out taking for their head cut off. Yeah. But if like once they're awarded that job, if you know what I mean, if that gets
Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so okay, so even uh so once it the thing's been awarded, you want information so you can follow up one way or the other. Yeah. Before it's been awarded it it you we should get the information, but we really just need to know when it's been awarded. You guys don't need to know anything before it's been awarded.

Michael Ricks
Why makes sense? Why does whoever they're getting a bid approved by or hoping to get their bid approved by, why do they need SWIPT and nothing else?

Lacie Slevin
What do you mean as far as what we're bidding?

Michael Ricks
If Leighton calls us for a bid and they're sending that bid with their bid to build the project to the owner, right? Why do they need a SWPPP bid and nothing else Like no other sort of thing.

Lacie Slevin
So one is built into their budget. SWPPP and sometimes spends are built into their budget budget the rest of the stuff is done as uh it's built differently. So they don't have to put that in their budget. That's all it comes from a different place.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know a hundred like all the details but what I guess too is it's required, right? Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Whereas a dumpster is technically I mean, they need it, but it's not required. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
And some companies will. Like some companies like to have a bid with everything.

Michael Ricks
Like they wanna you know what I mean?

Lacie Slevin
They wanna know what they're gonna spend on dumpster.

Michael Ricks
But yeah, I think it does have something to do with the fact that SWPPP is in their plans. It's part of their Okay Like they they need a sweat plan in place and to get to even to get your building permits to get like so but they don't need dumpsters figured out or tempens figured out or any that shit like so it's I think it's because it's a pot more a part of like their actual plans and getting the permits and all that trip every shit.

Lacie Slevin
But it's also built differently. Yeah. What is in their budget and one is not.

Michael Ricks
So I would ideally love to quote all of those things.

Lacie Slevin
So you know it's and if we're trying to forecast, you know, what we're gonna make. For only forecast and SWPPP, we're we we're not seeing like the potential of what we're gonna make on their project because we're not Yeah, I did see Jared send an estimate one time
Michael Ricks
where the SWPPP had an actual price where it hit the bottom of the total note and then like the other four pages in the estimate were like it's just here's the price.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, which I I hate.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, you don't oh wait, so can you repeat that?

Lacie Slevin
You don't So the bit the estimates when they go out, it's like here's your estimate for split based off your plan and the total for that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes. Then there's another page that says roll off, here's what that would cost. Just a month or a turn or whatever it is.

Lacie Slevin
But there's no quantities in there to then give you a total of what they're gonna spend on that.

Michael Ricks
they're gonna say there and and the reason like we're that we're setting it that way is because we've done lunch and learns like when we've done the lunch and learns these estimators want it that way. Because the estimators when they're getting this from Jared, if he puts all the rest on there and they have to manually go in and take all that shit out, it muddies the water for them. Well yeah, and it's and they can't just send that to Because they don't need that stuff when they're sending the initial like bid. So that's the reason why it's done that way is because we asked SMEs what works for us and for our forecasting purposes
Lacie Slevin
there has got to be a way that you could go in there and you could say, you know, like sweeper once a week, whatever, for the life of this project is going to be this amount. You can take that amount out and send them the estimate with just the sweat, but for our purposes, like it would be great to know what is this actually gonna net us, right?

Michael Ricks
Like we're changing from thirty thousand dollars.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah, we have no idea what we're gonna get from that project. It's not a thirty five thousand dollar project, it's a two hundred thousand. Oh I see.

Chi Ejimofor
So we're sending an estimate for twenty K.

Lacie Slevin
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
But y but we usually we usually add three or four things so you just don't know about how much it we don't know.

Michael Ricks
We don't how much that's gonna end up being in it. On some of them you do. The ones that we do know are the ones that we've done these at-risk bids where Jared has to go and spend hours trying to it's not an at-risk
Lacie Slevin
I have uh Clayco right now, which was 275,000 with all of our services. Now we're adding more and more stuff every day.

Michael Ricks
I know, but like this That wasn't an at-risk bid that
Lacie Slevin
That was what we quoted them.

Michael Ricks
Well but the two seventy-five, but if you do more dumpster turns, you're gonna have to change orders instead of the couple.

Lacie Slevin
Oh a hundred percent.

Michael Ricks
If you do if you add more P It's gonna be this, it's gonna be more like the two seventy-five is more like on that one, if it wasn't set up as an at-risk bid, that's more of a guesstimate at the end of the day.

Lacie Slevin
Yeah.

Michael Ricks
But a guesstimate is better than nothing. I'm just gonna do it.

Lacie Slevin
You know you've got a water truck out there. twice a week for this many hours or whatever, you could calculate what are we gonna make on this project.

Michael Ricks
And w I think we can probably do that, but like the initial quote that gets sent is
Chi Ejimofor
So this is more like the if if if there was a it's more like when we find out and we have a hopefully I mean if we finding out we're getting a contract contract sooner, but even the initial estimate or the estimate that we get before we get a contract and we modify some stuff, that would it would be preferred that you could well I guess that's the point. If we did win something then you guys could go out, sell and then And get get some of the information and then we're able to like put something together.

Michael Ricks
Like PJs, once we know we've got this, once we know we've got this. Then if then if like when we're sending it over to them
Chi Ejimofor
like if we can see like hey this is what you know kind of Yeah we have the estimate but now we added these things hey let's get the new estimate over and a new contract with these stuff.

Michael Ricks
we're gonna have you know it you can get a quick estimate on something like that roll off is hard because you don't know how many turns you're gonna get uh yeah I mean if you could right now
Lacie Slevin
I was saying Peyton just won this project and send me a PM an address and a start date even would be spectacular.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I can try to do that.

Lacie Slevin
for us.

Michael Ricks
But honestly, PM and address. Start date we can get. PM and address. Oh my God.

Lacie Slevin
I know. I'm just saying if you call I'm just saying if you're calling, yeah. Right? Could ask that question while you're having that conversation.

Michael Ricks
And again, I think that's the role that Rick is in currently, once it moves away from Rick, that's what that role should be doing all day, every day is calling
Lacie Slevin
Yeah. Because we're gonna have as this process starts, right? We're gonna have a lot of stuff that we weren't doing before. We're gonna have a lot of things coming over and so like I should be able to manage like, well this one doesn't start for eight months, right? So that's Like but then this one starts next month. Well that's the one I'm gonna go to first, right? That's the person I'm gonna reach out to first and manage my timeline, right? So if I had start dates, then I can look in there and say like I need to handle this right away and this one can be later or whatever, you know.

Michael Ricks
And if Monday could organize that.

Lacie Slevin
Well you can't I think I don't know if you can filter by screen
Michael Ricks
Do you think that kind of a random question would be whatever buy a front loader and dump uh dump truck?

Lacie Slevin
And would buy anything if we gave them enough reason to do so.

Michael Ricks
Because down the line maybe you're talking about the for the housing. Because I have all home builders and if we landed that It's like probably their biggest moneymaker in the woman neighborhood. What do you mean by the dumpsters? Oh. But they're all front low. Because we can't put a forty yard roll up between three houses.

Chi Ejimofor
It's tough.

Michael Ricks
I I had a I mean I had a gray star that was they had all the tiny little dumpsters. They had like 40 of them and I ended up up switching out all those for I think like eight forty yard dumpsters. That's on a huge site, right? No, it was on the one of the uh You know, little little houses. You know, like the straight up and down small backyard kind of Um it just depends.

Chi Ejimofor
on the WD site today. Uh RJ? Yeah. Yep. A big huge site. Their dumpster is about to overflow. Wonderful. Hi just like The one the one at the entrance. The one closes? By the by the trailer. Okay. Well that's a good how are you supposed to is there any way to n be no be know about this stuff before you get like a complaint or or something that's like a problem?

Michael Ricks
Well is it like you guys checking in on the car Yeah if we could go to every site every day.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, we can't do that.

Michael Ricks
and it's kind of that more white glove service. So I was out there yesterday, I checked all of them. They must have I mean obviously they have a lot of shit coming in and out right now.

Chi Ejimofor
They like freaking ads out there man. Yeah, that's so many people. Like like front motors flipping us off because we're driving too slow. Seriously? That was me. Uh some one of the operators took a picture of us. Really? Yeah.

Michael Ricks
Like we're we were coming on the Who were you with?

Chi Ejimofor
I was with uh Uh Aaron? Oh Rome. We're doing the um PJs? Yeah. Um but yeah, we were on the we were on the s the south side coming towards the trailer because there was a rough Interesting.

Michael Ricks
I don't know. What? The truck? Repeat J trucks? Yeah.

Brandon Slevin
Did a ROM hit you with his. You smell that? Smell it. He did say that. Yeah, you smell that? And I was like, yeah, it smells like shit Smells like money.

Michael Ricks
I love it.

Chi Ejimofor
Um So it's really it's really just having a so even for rollout like it's they have to call to to set it up. Or or they have to contact you.

Michael Ricks
So per perfect example is I just got a text message from one of my super right now that I'm answering back. Hey Brandy can you do me a favor uh get the dumpster at baseline dumped and return tomorrow thanks.

Chi Ejimofor
How often let us know.

Michael Ricks
Now our Terra because we did the whole ab risk like and white loss service they expect us we need to kind of we should be really this one is a guinea pig on my new my new Artera like the other big one that I've got They are way more chill and we didn't necessarily like start off with the expectation of like everything you need.

Chi Ejimofor
That's our terror right now.

Michael Ricks
But on that one, it's expected that like if the PJ driver's out there and he sees that the dumpster is full, that he would reach
Chi Ejimofor
And the PJ drivers are there almost every day or what? Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Okay. So these guys are so we have so they should do they are they pretty decent about? There's a lot of truck guy out there every day, right? Yeah.

Michael Ricks
water truck but um but yeah we've got roll off guys that are out there that you know if they're out there and they're using a PJ and it's disgusting hit me up. If the PJ guys out there see that roll off needs to be taken care of. You know what I mean? So and then I'm out there twice a week. So on that site it's a little bit different. On our day-to-day site, they're gonna reach out and eat a U n I need you to drop another PJ or pick one up.

Lacie Slevin
Hey, I need you to pull the dumpster so prior to uh this role they were calling each director for each service, which is way too much for them to have Yeah. Who do I call for roll up? Oh, is that Kelly? Is that Kelly?

Chi Ejimofor
They have dumpster and PJ, it's a roofing company. And the the owner called me is like my dumpster. Yeah. So I called Wendy and we got it figured out. out but he's like I don't want to call three people to get the stuff out.

Lacie Slevin
Who's the company, do you know?

Chi Ejimofor
CM roofing, CMI roofing, something like that. But I don't I don't Know I'm gonna go and look and see how much work they look. I think they're I think we're brand new. Yeah. I think we just set them up.

Lacie Slevin
I mean ultimately every company that we could bring bring on should have a sales rep, right? Like ideally. That's not.

Michael Ricks
Is that who we were just with? That's what I was just gonna ask you. I think they were called Prem Premier. Yeah, maybe it was Premier.

Chi Ejimofor
His last name is G Con, I think.

Michael Ricks
Well, so we we were with one of their like divisional sales guys um at the GCon event. That guy was a party. I miss that guy.

Lacie Slevin
I miss that guy.

Michael Ricks
And I don't even I don't even do that guy's stuff.

Chi Ejimofor
That guy was funny. Oh. Not CMR. Yeah, we were RSMI commercial roofing. Oh, okay. RSMI. Roger P cops. Anyway. Okay. That's well, I got it. The other thing that you might look at if you're gonna be out at that site tomorrow on the southwest corner. There's But like there's just stuff coming over all the time. It'd be great if you're going to be able to do that. Oh, we just got a contract open for slips. So like I'm gonna reach out to them and try and get another stuff. But it'd be just nice if you were just kind of dismissing this. Yeah, I think that was the one of the ideas. Yes. Because everybody has to go and read it. It's like w why are we doing that?

Michael Ricks
Yeah, Redpoint will have to come and dig it out and then the next time we service we'll get it filled but that you know that's on red point that's not okay but it's something to be aware of no for sure I appreciate it because yeah I mean I was just out there yesterday
Chi Ejimofor
And it wasn't very must happen yesterday. We got it all.

Michael Ricks
Sure. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Cool. I appreciate it. No, no, thank you, sir.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, we're good. Um we'll uh digest it some information I think the the relief in the short term will be kind of uh some contract stuff, but Tim doesn't want me to do anything until like two weeks from now. I'm like bruh, we I can I'm not that slow. Uh come on man. I can start working, you know.

Michael Ricks
If you sell a new job, do you quote it yourself? No, Jared quoted it. Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
We we played with the idea of us quoting our own things.

Michael Ricks
Like you don't quote anything.

Lacie Slevin
Oh that was we didn't give them pricing like hey dumpsters are this or hey Yeah, absolutely you can do that. You just can't I mean you could if you knew how, you could send a split quote, but do you know how to quote SWPPP?

Michael Ricks
look at plenty yeah exactly that's what I mean Jared does well and and like technically like quote kind of seems like a loose term like the actual quote is SWPPP and all this other stuff though like for pjs and for some of this you're just giving them pricing if like literally if I type in an email um hey you need three you know three pjs Um three times. Well no, I'm just saying like, hey, you need three PJs. I include our PJ director. Can you please confirm? They confirm. Like there's no actual like quote.

Lacie Slevin
You can give them price.

Michael Ricks
Yeah, it's just kind of pricing. So I mean.

Chi Ejimofor
So you guys send you guys like send the you guys give pricing all the time, but if it's an actual obviously for SWPPP or some bigger job, then it's like alright, then you're like, hey Let's get a quote and you'll contact right now. You contact Jared to do it or you'll contact Kendra or somebody else.

Michael Ricks
Jared.

Chi Ejimofor
Jared. You'll contact Jared for the bigger quotes. And then if you need something specific, obviously you just go directly to whatever director is in charge and you say hey you need to just like he did just in that well well I guess he he caught in talk contact with you to get in contact with Ellie? Which one is it? K uh Wendy Wendy. Wendy and Wendy Corolla. Yeah. Um And those guys are pretty everybody um that you work with I guess there's some issues with water truck quality. That's the only one.

Lacie Slevin
We've t I've talked to Tim about that. He's he's aware of it. Um it's something we might change 'cause I think there was a bit of a gap in like how we were doing that.

Chi Ejimofor
Like wait, what's the so what is the issue that people are having?

Lacie Slevin
It's so when the P J guys go out there they do the PJs, right? But they weren't doing the fresh water tanks on the trailers. We were having the water division, the water truck go out and do that, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me because then they have to make A separate chip just for that.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Lacie Slevin
And so it was getting missed.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Lacie Slevin
So really it should be the Porjon guy handles that, right? When he does, when he cleans out the waste tank, he should be filling
Michael Ricks
Yeah, I was you know, I was thinking about that this morning, and I think the reason why they don't do it is because the only way for the PJ guy to like Fill it is with a regular hose. That motherfucker would take forever. I mean That's true.

Lacie Slevin
I'm just I'm gonna figure it out the button.

Michael Ricks
I was trying to figure out when we had our Meaning like why the hell would they sell?

Lacie Slevin
Does it cost us more to send a full truck of water?

Michael Ricks
Do you remember they'd get out of the truck and Albert would hang that bucket on something and he'd open a lever
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, it's not it's not like a regular.

Lacie Slevin
And it cost still costs us more to send a water truck to a site just to fill up a a freshwater tank, which we're making absolutely nothing on. We don't bill for that. So then we just sent a truck out there and wasted two hours at minimum.

Michael Ricks
For yeah for nothing.

Lacie Slevin
For nothing.

Michael Ricks
No, I mean I I agree. I I'm just saying that maybe that's why they said But I forgot they do have that. But like on Albert's truck for example, I didn't see a hose like that. But I think they can hook it up to it. You know the water truck hose? I didn't see that type of Interesting.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Thank you for the time. Catch you guys. But I know he's bringing another 200 feet of fence Oh my goodness, sick.
