# Tim 1-on-1 Oct 30

Tim Haitaian
We really need to go back to like what is our sales like workflow process and um you know what are all the ways that a new project like enters the system A salesperson could make us aware of a project. Estimating could make us aware of a project. What you do after that might change based on where it starts or how, you know, all that kind of stuff. What are the action steps that should be taken along the way? And regardless of if we win or lose the bid, we could still win other services. You know, so anyways, um, and then project will start and then it's like enters the handoff phase you know um but it sounds like you're picking up all the right stuff there um you know the contract stuff and the project execution. You know, Jason and Kendra both pointed out that it wasn't explicitly described there. It was implied. It's sort of, that is the process. that we need to document. So like I didn't call it out specifically, but for what it's worth in my head, you know, between you and I, like that was implied in that. Yeah. But I understand from their perspective, they want to make sure that it's like explicitly called out. So I thought that was important to do that and give some prompts to you for the contracting side and the project execution delivery side. Um so and then the other was um adding that third thing for shifting narratives from Jason to Eva. And I didn't want to overload you in month one. And so I made it a month two objective. Yeah. That's why I did that and made it like a day sixty goal, not a day thirty goal. So I was like, she's got enough already going to just document the existing process. and keep learning and shift the dust make dust permits and the sign making over. I don't need to add a third thing to that. That's why I made that at day 60. Just saying

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. The SWPPP I I was looking into it a little bit. When I when when Jason was showing me it, I was it's you know, it's the same as uh The whole thing, I mean if you have all the information, it literally it's it's a template. I mean they actually provide you a template on the internet. I mean of course we have our our own version But it's it's literally a template. If you have all the information it just plugs straight straight in and so it's all about getting up so it's just yeah and then so again automate you know Being able to that can be automated, uh, to an extent, of course. The book of course needs to be printed out, put it together, but the actual thing where I was like, is she really going through and And typing in all these places, that's wild. I think she might be doing some control F, so that's that saves some effort, but uh I was I was like, Well yeah, that's a lot of work if she's just going through and manually and of course there's the margin for error he's he or he said he'll be checking certain peop places for different things oh you missed this you missed this I mean, um it's not it's not AI. It's like literally you give the information in here and then this is the information in that needs to be filled in. And it's just automatic and fills fills it in for you. So when I saw that the book, I was like, that could be automated. And then of course there's two pieces that you have to manually Do. Mm-hmm. Um, but yeah, but the it's it it what is it? Uh the quality of the thing is as good as what you put in.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah. Uh Yeah, good input, good output, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
Um one thing you mentioned earlier that I I loved to hear is you're thinking about offshore resources. resources for some of this stuff because there's no doubt there are pieces of this business that like don't need to be a full-time American salary staff member to execute like there's probably lots of like little fragments of jobs too that like we should just be pushing that into some type of resource like that. So you know I'd encourage you to find those things too. And automations, all of it. Like this business is ripe for those kinds of things. There's so many places that you could do that kind of thing. I love that you're finding that. Um, you know, I want to make sure, you know, I'm out next week, right? Yeah, all week okay. All week next week. And so I wanted to make sure before I leave that, you know, you Do you feel like you're getting the information that you need from people? That people are being responsive to you. You know, do you do you feel that way?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, no issues. Uh of course people I can just been busy some days, uh so we had push a couple times but um other than that uh other than that everything's been and then kelly of course but he's out on vacation so That's fine. Um yeah, I'll have to schedule I still need to schedule the CRO training, which I think Wendy's not Wendy, uh Karen uh will help me with tomorrow hopefully. But other than that, yeah, no everybody's uh I think everybody's busy but even with their busyness they'll still always basically Put whatever is to the side too a second and and answer questions. So that's good. I kind of feel bad a little bit. I'm like, I know you guys are grinding. So but they'll yeah, everybody's generous everybody's pretty helpful. Uh so things have been good. It's good. Yeah. That's awesome.

Tim Haitaian
Well it seems like you're grinding too, man. I mean you're it seems like you're like hussing out.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I'm trying to put together the the mental uh model of it, which is the overall it's not bad. I guess it's now it's the more the well how do you you know, how do you do it, you know? uh or what yeah how do you do it. And I think you have to either learn Monday uh to an extent and get some stuff over there, uh to s start to fail I guess if you want to call it like that and then improve. Or um you know, s trial uh other things, you know. secretly. Yeah. You know, in the background. Uh I have a couple things scheduled. So I'm just every time I just talk with the guys and see what Yes, see what they see what they say, you know. I tell 'em what we what we have and w you know. It's an interesting it's it's uh it seems like there's a well now I need to now I need to just do the Crow because I think Crow's is you know understanding how Crow works would un would unlock a a bunch of stuff. And then all that's left is really the SWPPP stuff which is probably again at the end project management on a on a maybe even in my old Trello but Monday we already have Monday at works just project management Uh where you're just going line by line, the your dust permit, do they need a SWIPT book? Yes or yes. This is scheduled for this date, the date comes, you know, who's in charge? Or you somebody's just checking in yeah on every it's basically that when I'm looking at it I'm like the at the end it could be the same as you know the equipment installations that I was doing before. You just have dates on all the stuff and you're just checking in.

Tim Haitaian
Like you're you're visualizing like Jason's sweatmaster in Trello and and if we get some of the information for him up front it's all like right there for And he just has a nice neat orderly board and he's like, okay, uh just like manage the stuff that's here and new stuff just shows up and he works through it and gets closer

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, because I mean even I'm my Monday has the same board I like boards. I like the moving things across. But when you're in boards, yeah. It's like when something's in progress, 'cause some stuff it's in progress Uh I liked for me I had things uh you know depending on what was in progress. So if there was yeah It was uh electrical or this or this, I would have it in different kind of stages or boards for that. Uh not boards, but different columns for it. But overall it's he has when I look at his thing He has stuff that there's something waiting to finish. So he'll just kind of add to it ongoing until it's done and then he'll kind of move it well he won't move yeah and it'll move it to the separate uh board. So it works like that. The only thing is I'm just he has a they have an interesting way of like I don't know, adding information in it's not just you know install rocks. It's like Joey's gonna install rocks and it's gonna be eight hundred you know, three hundred pounds and it's gonna be you know he adds a bunch of extra little informations onto the onto the line and then we'll schedule it you know so It yeah I have the I have some idea, but I think it's I have to I actually have to as as I ha person I have to make it, I have to see it and then Uh yeah, it's weird because of because he has a very specific way of working. And I'm also trying to think of the the connection with uh with Kendra whenever you know if you if I click done on something I can uh you can attach somebody to it, but you click done on something, does it where does it going? How is it being seen by somebody else? Is there like a somehow a a thing, you know? You know, kick her an email with all the details of what was done.

Tim Haitaian
And then she's got emails in her inbox and say, Oh, okay, as soon as you get one, it's like I know or she can just stash those or whether she has access to the board and she can go in and like completed she has her own board that's completed but not yet build or like in process build or build but no contract yet or whatever Her permutations of this scenario.

Chi Ejimofor
I like because mur and Monday can do it's like I like the idea of everybody there's kind of a master and that's why to me Monday and all the it's the way it's works it's basically a I mean it's Excel's a database. All these are databases. Yeah. The Mundane notion all these guys are just connecting all of them in a master thing. So technically you could have everything together and master them. But the beautiful beauty is that theoretically you can just take all the data and give it, this is what you need to see. This is what she needs to see, this is what she needs to see. And then And then you just log in and do what you need to do that's on that you can see. And if you want, you can look at other people's stuff. You know? Maybe maybe on a read-only or you can ask. Uh, but you have to make it so that whoever's directly using it understands everything. thing and then whoever doesn't want to use it you're able to send them what they need to see which is possible just cleanly in an email that's what F O was saying she likes email. So I'm like, yeah, if you don't want to use Mondays, like putting the dust permit thing, boom, boom. This is the information attach the file, a picture of the site with that circled. with the entrances and then you get to work or you know somewhere else. Uh so it's uh it's that's the that's the I think it's the hard Hard part. I think uh I think the other thing is you don't have to be I don't know, you don't have to be perfect probably. I'm like putting pressure. I'm like, well it's whatever I do it's gotta be like this. It's gotta be uh amazing for me the first thing and I've probably has to do a job and then you can get better. Yeah. Uh so I'm trying to kind of balance the you know, a mate like from for from the first moment versus uh okay, this is probably something thing that works and then this is a basic thing. Yeah. Look at it. Right. Tell me what you hate. Right. I don't know. And keep it going.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah, I mean I always say don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and especially like your B one, you know, we know like we're building in that we know it's not gonna be perfect. Yeah. You know, and that's why okay, we're gonna try to get B one by like day ninety and then that gives us another ninety days to iterate and keep it going, you know, I'm getting it to where we want to go. You know, don't feel married to Monday. Yeah. One thing I from my perspective looking and playing with Monday like if we're gonna stick with it I think it might make sense that we like start fresh with all these boards and all these integrations and things. And the only other thing with like a tool like that is I feel like it's a little bit brittle and fragile and like Some of the integrations and linkages that you make can eat very, very easily kind of get like goofed up. But you know, it's nice that it's flexible, but it it's almost like not rigid enough in some ways to like force like f enforce like fidelity and you know it it's almost like you might not even know that something's broken for a while or something I don't know, something like that that that's a feeling I have.

Chi Ejimofor
It's built yeah, you can make it it's it it's it's uh it's basically a no code tool. You're it's a no code thing where you're just kind of building your own thing. Yeah. Um but that's the benefit that you get with the software that's built for uh that's built for something because you can't do certain things. They make a decision. You know, they make it dis uh opinionated, opinionated software. It's like, hey, this is what this does, this is what he can't do, you can't do this. Right. You know, I talked to the guys, yeah, they're like we can't do AIA stuff in here. So if you want to do that, you can't do it. All right, cool, thank you. Right. You know, but some people can. So but the opinions it you know, they cut off some of the market, but then it makes it obviously like oh holy holy crap holy shit this is for us this is exact exactly um but yeah that's the gift and the curse of those kind of open ended Mondays and and Notion.

Tim Haitaian
Um yeah, so I mean maybe you know honestly like we're gonna take steps with this and you know hey even if we build the setup in Monday that were like this looks really good, this feels great, and we use it for six months, but maybe it educates us enough to say, you know, those more rigid stuff solutions that are out there and we know oh that one works the way we work in this one it's like that will work for us. It's designed how we want to work. That'll that'll do. And then we're living in in a much more like buttoned up system. Okay, if that if that takes us six to twelve months from today, like that's fine. We have a very long horizon on what we're doing. Right. So you know, I don't want to invest in something that a month later throw it away. But also like we're we're taking step step here you know we're not trying to hit the bullseye on the first try like hit the paper and get a little closer a little closer a little closer but Um, okay. Um, is there anything that you're waiting on me for? Um, you know, when I'm gone, feel free, you can use Don's credit card for um dust permits. Yeah. Um also we should just issue you one which I think we may have already, although they'll take like ten days to get here. So I I should check Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, I know I know Logan I saw I know Logan got an email, for example, and and he had to set something up, but they haven't done it. I haven't gotten this thing yet so I don't know if I don't know if I'll get something similar. Yeah. Um but finally I think I I did uh figure out the QuickBooks so that'll be nice. Oh there was an interesting thing with Well qu you probably it they we so you know this something we buy we bought something called Sightline. I looked at Sightline. Sightline looks like it's built for I mean it's built for a construction company It's got the retenti detenti retention. It's got retainage in there. Cause when I asked Kendra, I was like hot so what what's outstanding? She was like, I've I don't know Oh why don't you know that? But because and she's like, well if we do if we pull a report we can't see retainers versus outstanding. I'm like, that's I mean ridiculous probably. But then I look at I look at yeah, look at Sightline. It's got it's got retainage, it's got scheduled values, it's got not connections to all the other platforms, but like yeah you know, ex exports you can just market. I I was like that looked it looked like it was built for this you know for uh for a construction company. I was just gonna get your what what was your perspective? I mean you guys already purchased it at least for she said they're using it for change orders only. But what is the QuickBooks? I know ever all the day all the data from history is in the QuickBooks, so that's probably one of the things. things. But yeah, what was I'm and this is you know, yeah, what was the um you guys got sightline, yeah what what's the I guess reason yeah so one way or the other.

Tim Haitaian
The way that change orders were managed in the past uh was through QuickBooks and um you know this is not being critical of Kendra uh in any way. The way that they managed it was they kind of like in a way this sounds harsher than it's meant to uh like kind of bastardize the way you like invoices and like open invoices and so there would be always like open invoices from like a year ago or more with tracking on these change orders and then there would be like negative revenue lines to kind of true it up and it's all stuff that should not be being done inside your general ledger and your financial it should be managed elsewhere and when you know what the number is you can then move it into functions you know. Yep. And so sightline the other thing was keeping all these invoices open and it was almost like using an o an invoice as like a journal. Like literally like a Yeah, she that's what she said.

Chi Ejimofor
I heard that yeah. Even she they're still doing it a little bit with uh monthly with the monthly

Tim Haitaian
invoices but yeah and so um you know uh you're probably aware of this but like you know it's important that with financials at some point you lock down a prior period so that it doesn't change anymore. And you know that's definitely like year end is that way, quarter end, um maybe even month end. But to allow her to use QuickBooks in the way that she was for change orders required us to leave invoices that were like year or more old open.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
And then if we locked it down, it would lock those invoices or whatever stage they were at. You know, it was like freeze it in time.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
And so what Well we we needed to like take the change order tracking journaling just keeping track of what's what and move that outside of QuickBooks so that we didn't have these like straggler invoices that were being used as like a notepad basically to keep track of these change orders and that those change orders would live somewhere else and then only touch the general ledger when stuff happened. Yep. So that was that was the reason why it came in. Yeah. Okay. I don't think it's probably been uses full advantage. I'm not sure how you know, she's really the only one I think in there for the most part.

Chi Ejimofor
She is which everybody well, using it probably.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah. Yeah. Um so But I don't know if I yeah, I guess the I don't know if for tainage and all that, I don't know if seeing

Chi Ejimofor
open well yeah I don't know if I remember back in the day at Evo Evo qua yeah we had uh we had like SAP which was I probably the same as the quick but we had like you know it's old software we had to plug it in but then we had our modern thing thing that we we like entered it in twice but we had our modern one that we used to actually see okay hey this project has Like eighty thousand has been spent and yeah. So we kinda had like these two things. But because of that, yeah, you you were able to see at a glance, oh yeah. In the modern one, you could see it in the other one as well, but in the modern one you'll be able to see two seconds like what what's out there and what's happening. Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah. I mean it'd be a lot nicer also for financial reporting stuff if we could classify things as retaining Hverse just a little more open.

Chi Ejimofor
And the AIA it's cool. I mean they have it's set up for it. It's a I I I was like man can I be accountant Uh but no it's like at any time I'm like like looking at it. No, it's too n well nerdy isn't the thing, it's just that's probably too boring.

Tim Haitaian
But I mean it's nice that like anytime someone develops a convention and then people follow it. Yeah. It's like, okay, that's cool. Yeah. Everyone's on the same page with how are you supposed to think about this stuff, you know? Yeah. So like that that's cool I think.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And then it's from the government. Yeah, so it it wor I mean it works and then uh what's it called? Uh yeah, that sight line puts you put in the financial information exactly like that. Yeah and it It does it exactly. So you you're supposed to multiply every time you build something you multiply it by the number of retainage, ten percent.

Tim Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And then automatically gets put in a column and then at the end it you charge, you know, your I think you have a special uh form that's just retainage and then you charge for that. I was like, well that works. Yeah. Instead of yeah So that but that's you know that's a whole nother thing. But I was just like that was like a side thing when I when I was listening to her talk about that stuff. I was like this Okay, you know, as a P as a person I can't be I can't be sitting there not knowing how much you know. Yeah. People didn't pay you yet. We we're having to change you have you're having to ch I don't know, I didn't like this thing where you had to like uh at the end of the project after everything we did all the work and then you look at the schedule of values and we did more then you have to issue a change order but now they don't it's not a priority anymore because they already started it. So they don't care as much. Right. And and now you're having to I don't know, chase people for money. I'm I'm not a fan of chasing people for money personally, you know, but So anyway, that but that's a whole nother thing. But I I liked Sightliner, it was pretty. It was pretty, it's well made. QuickBooks is QuickBooks works. Sideline is pretty. Maybe it works. That's what I don't know.

Tim Haitaian
It absolutely worked. It was the ugliest fucking thing you probably have ever seen from there. I mean it was it was genuine like internet 1. 0 like maybe 0. 1 internet like The interface was so confusing and so messy and shit was so buried, but it was like bulletproof. It came to work. You know, it did exist Exactly what you wanted it to do. But well um, you know, I uh again I just want to make sure we caught up today before I left. If there's anything that you needed from me, if you thought you set up for success next week when we'll be here. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
It seems like you're chugging, you know, along so yeah, I should be good. I think next week next week uh just have the I guess one or two more. Uh I guess I'll I'll meet with Steven at the end of the week 'cause I want to give him a little bit of time to understand what he's supposed to be doing. Yeah. And then and then we'll meet Uh and then other than that, yeah, to next week I'll start to uh I did I showed yeah next week I'll start to do some of the SOP uh I guess I have the SOPs already, but it's like start to kind of bring E Eva in and look at stuff and then you know You know, and then try a couple, a few and see what she runs into uh with the yeah, with both of them. And but yeah, it's it does feel it's like a little those uh other ones they're like it's it's um you almost have to like proactively I have to like start a little bit the project quar you know, project coordinator thing 'cause you It's like we need they she needs it would be nice to have better information, you know, so but we'll see we'll see how I figure it out.

Tim Haitaian
information like all the details to do a dust permit.

Chi Ejimofor
Is that yes for for dust permit and for uh and for sign ordering Yeah. I know. Both of them, it's not the worst.

Tim Haitaian
It's not hard, but it's just like You're picking up on what is the challenge though. It's like getting all that information actually is the challenge. So it's like how do we efficiently collect that either like along the way in the bidding process or like as part of what the bidding process already is? So it's like he's already entering that information for himself, knowing that once it gets awarded we go, it's like these ten pieces of information all get pulled into this one thing that then gets delivery so she can do her thing. Right. You know, and that I think that is like part of the challenge of this like, you know, what comes from which per who has that information it probably exists somewhere or if it doesn't who's the person that we need to reach out to to go get it and maybe that's part of her task too is like you know we only I'm only gonna give you seven of the ten pieces typically but I will tell you who to go get it for the last piece from and that's part of your task too is you gotta go hunt down these last two pieces maybe that's That's part of the the process.

Chi Ejimofor
Like one of them was just like this the address of the site. And it's on the bid. But I didn't have the bid. I had I have the switch plan. Which has the address sometimes, but this time it didn't. Yeah. It's like, you know, so I don't have to go to Jared and he has to go back to the email and it's like, well, you know, so maybe you attach But again, it's like maybe you attach the bid to the the bid email to the the Monday. But then and then the Monday should be linked to the dust permit and you can just poll that everything over and you're just like if you need to see different things you so there's like little uh quick stuff.

Tim Haitaian
Uh yeah. Yeah so do you feel confident about um you know hitting at day thirty for kind of what the objectives are for that first month. Yeah, I think that yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I was even um I was even like I was looking at it like man I could do all this next week. But I was like, let me like let me chill. Let me chill.

Tim Haitaian
No, that's good. I mean hey, fuck, man. If we can move faster, great. Yeah. I also want to set reasonable expectations for everybody else and make sure that you You don't I don't want to cut your word short. You deserve time and space to do quality work. You're brand new here. There's so much you're learning. Like the la the worst thing would be like, all right man, day 15, where is it? You know, it's like what like I'm still getting my computer set up, you know whatever. Yeah. No, we need to give you time and space for it. I think the 60 and 90 I could see you accelerating, but again, like I'd rather you drive that ship. And that's fucking awesome if we do. So um well hey man, I um to share with you, like I I have a lot of confidence in the way things are going. and the steps already being taken and like the questions that you're asking and the the difficulties and some of the complexities and nuances that you're already identifying. is like these are the bottlenecks, these are the challenges, how we solve for that. Like you're picking up on all the right stuff, I think. So that tells me like you're working through the process. Doing everything necessary. It just gives me a lot of confidence. So well I see I'm super happy with the progress so far. Obviously got a long way to go. Yeah. But it's not like you're still twiddling your thumbs like figuring out who I could talk to. No. You're you're deep. You're pretty deep like already.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
So it's impressive.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Keep it deep. Thank you. No, it's I mean it's also a you know pretty f I mean I've been at uh you know company companies where it's yeah yeah you gotta you you gotta yeah, I mean different levels, yeah. So this one's e everybody's on a chart that I can see in in one little dance. Yeah.

Tim Haitaian
Versus

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. It's also not yeah, it's not rocket, you know. Well it's not rockets. I uh God, you know, I'm not I'm not looking at, you know, what the I'm ignoring what the rocket guys are doing and I'm just telling them what you know Yeah. So this is this is a lot uh this is a lot chiller.

Tim Haitaian
Uh SpaceX launched a rocket from Vandenberg. Uh I think it was earlier this week or it was last week.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. I've always wanted to s I wanted to see them I wanted to see him well I haven't s I've never seen a rocket launch and I've I've also wanted to see him catch that shit again because that I would love both of those looking in person.

Tim Haitaian
All I could see was the clouds. streak yeah from it. Because one day I was walking my dog in my neighborhood and I turned this corner, I look up and I'm like, what the fuck is that? And it was rocket. Well I didn't know it was a rocket. It was just like this thing that's streaking across the sky and I thought it was like kind of a satellite but there's a plume behind it I'm like looking and I'm watching what it is and you know when it gets to the upper atmosphere and you see like Like the plume like really widens out from it's almost like a big skirt at the bottom of the rocket and the the exhaust plume and everything gets really wide And there's almost like lines, like streaks from the bottom of the rocket. I could see that in the sky. And then I look up and is there SpaceX launch tonight? And there was. And it was pretty cool to see. But I was re-watching it the other night when I was
