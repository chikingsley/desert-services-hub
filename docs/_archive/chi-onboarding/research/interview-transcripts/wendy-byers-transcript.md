# Wendy Byers Transcript

Chi Ejimofor
I'm good.

Wendy Byers
I don't know how to do it on my phone.

Chi Ejimofor
It's all good. Hopefully it's oh you got a nice you got one of the nice chairs at the house. Oh I need one of you I mean I have this here but I need Yeah I have the same one I think you got. So you just transferred everything to the to the home.

Wendy Byers
It's nice No, my office was already up here when I joined.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Oh yeah.

Wendy Byers
And I'd already worked from home. So I was like, I'm working from home if you want me because I live in SHOLO.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. What's your what's your background?

Wendy Byers
Um, I've been with Roloff for like seventeen years.

Chi Ejimofor
Wow. Yeah.

Wendy Byers
Other than that I was with uh Prize fries it was Smitty's for like twenty-two years.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
That's why I'm ready to retire.

Chi Ejimofor
You're ready to get out of here.

Wendy Byers
Um Now what are you doing? Are you doing estimating or what?

Chi Ejimofor
I'm a a project coordinator which is they don't have one yet. So I guess it's something like uh I guess one of the there's a few ideas for the job. It's kinda like helping everybody in a way but it's more like uh they sitting in between the estimating so the they finish an estimate and the uh getting the contract and then after the contract This is like the part where they want me to sit. Uh b because as a as I'm aware, there's not a clear distinction of we don't actually find out a lot of the times when we win a contract, we find out through other ways they'll ask us for a dust permit, they'll ask us for something and then we'll oh we won. Okay and then we start to go um Then we start to go through the process. Or when we get a contract, it sounds like they'll send it out to everybody and ever all of you have to like read through if you're you know Uh or some people they read through the contract to see if they're involved, which is a little inefficient and um Yeah, so kind of greasing that wheel and then I think in addition um S uh and and uh some maybe some in the middle between sales and you guys as well. But Who knows? We're still figuring it out. I think that's why I'm here. I'm I'm like talking to everybody just trying to map out how the work flows and where the If you where the breakdowns or where like the it bottlenecks or issues in communication happen and then you know seeing where Seeing where I can help. But right now, mainly I think the main things are like uh contract stuff And like the beginning of projects, project initiation, talking with the people, organizing stuff. But uh yeah, that's that's the idea. We'll see uh If it how how closely it ends up matching.

Wendy Byers
But yeah, so you're one of the people you do roll-offs and you're one of the two people that use the crow system Yeah, I know. They didn't have it until I started.

Chi Ejimofor
Really?

Wendy Byers
They didn't have a database. And I said, you guys, you cannot be doing all this shit on an Excel spreadsheet. It's a m it was just it was a mess.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
So we got the database then.

Chi Ejimofor
So you did you um did you use something like Crow before in a past role?

Wendy Byers
Did Yeah, we used I've used box tracker. Um we had a a program at one company where I started that we homemade.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Wendy Byers
Um so yeah, I mean and it's Pox tractor's good. There's little bugs in it I don't like that I've told the the people with Crow about, you know, but it is what it is. There's gonna be bugs in everything.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah Uh I guess on the specific, let me see. Uh let me get my notes file open here. Uh Roll off. Uh well yeah, you'd be a good person to talk to then because you've experienced I think the people who have like a background in the thing are are the most interesting because they have they've seen other ways of happening so they can even notice Like if if you probably gave me the crow training I probably wouldn't notice any uh I might notice some issues, but I wouldn't notice it in the same way where you you might because you've been you've used other systems. Um but I guess I mean I don't know let's start from the top. Um let's start from the top in general. Who uh how do you get work Or how do you understand that you have something to do?

Wendy Byers
So like I have a ton of customers that came with me. I've been doing this for so many years that my customers have followed me from day one. Um because of the customer service. I am all about you've gotta have customer service.

Chi Ejimofor
You know what?

Wendy Byers
And I don't care if that means answering my phone at eight o'clock at night, that's what you gotta do. That's how my customers I pray, I mean some of 'em are freaking out that I'm leaving. And I'm like, look, I promise whoever takes over, I mean I pray it I pray they'll be the same as me.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah.

Wendy Byers
People don't want I mean, I don't have children, I'm single, so it's different. I can answer my phone twenty-four seven. You know. Um, but and I know everybody doesn't want to do that, but I mean that's how to me you build up your customers. You know, these guys get home um from working and then they get on their thing and go, oh crap, I forgot to order my dumpster, you know, or something, so they'll call late. But um I also use Blue Book So I do some bidding through that.

Chi Ejimofor
So you bid uh blue book. Okay, I'm I'm I'm familiar with this. Um so you do your own bid what is you do your own Let me see this. Can you show me that? I don't know. Well you're not on your computer, but okay, you use something called what is blue book
Wendy Byers
It's just a bidding system that um it's called bid bbb did bid the blue book and um we've been using that since I started with with Mike Oh, can you shh what's it called exactly? Maybe it's BBB.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
I D dot the bluebook. com. But you have to be, we pay for it, and then they have to get you on as a user. Yeah And it throws up little jobs here and there and I can go in there and bid on them. I mean right now we're overwhelmed because you know I have a I have two guys that'll be I have a new guy starting Monday and I have another guy coming back from Is the vacation Monday because we're just slammed. I mean we've just been slammed.

Chi Ejimofor
Wait, so you bid on okay, so you're like operating you you really are operating as your almost your own unit you know business unit within the thing where you'll you'll have never had salespeople in any of my companies.

Wendy Byers
Um I mean this is new that he's hired all these salespeople but yeah I mean I've done my own thing. Like I said, 90% will follow me, you know. Um, so hopefully they stay.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
Um You know, I'm praying. I mean, but some of our bigger ones, you know, I'm studying.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm sure some people will you know, but it's I think it's about 'cause I've I'm hearing yeah, I mean it's a it's a I think it's about Um yeah, it's about having the system set up so that it can it obviously people have a personal relationship, you know you can't help those things, but as far as like the service level, theoretically you should be able to match it. But let's see. So you bid on your own projects through this website. And so you um what is uh I guess I'll have to who else uses who else uses this
Wendy Byers
Um, you know, I don't know. Let me see here who who else has access to this. Let me see.

Chi Ejimofor
But you don't you don't have anybody else helping you with bids. You you do it.

Wendy Byers
I have nobody that works with me other than my drivers.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
Yeah. Well, so So yeah, Don, Mike, I don't know who Rick is, and Jeff Gardner, Mike Lanning, Don and me. Yeah, that's it.

Chi Ejimofor
Don, and that's Don, my my bill my uh my billing friend over here. Dawn? That's Dawn the Billing Billing.

Wendy Byers
And I don't know what she uses it for. I don't know. Okay I use it for pre-qualifications.

Chi Ejimofor
She says she uses it for pre-qualifications, I guess. But she'll show me she'll show me this website. Okay. So you you bid on work here and they'll tell you if you win, I guess. And so this is one source of work. Do you get work?

Wendy Byers
You don't just bed on through here. What I do, you can bed through bluebug. but i personally go in and take their email and i email them too so i get more response to the person the email that's on blue book because blue book i mean they'll send you yeah this job was bidded or this was awarded but i get more when i do both ways
Chi Ejimofor
So you do both ways and you get more, okay.

Wendy Byers
Yeah, they're they're more up to respond to their own email than Blue Book, I think
Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, because blue b yeah, so I have to do these website emails. Honestly, half the time I get these website emails, I'm like delete you know, almost without looking at some of these. Uh so you okay And you do you s uh I guess you do an intro, do you send like the the estimate thing like in the first intro email or you're like hey saw you were looking for roll off what's going on type of thing
Wendy Byers
Uh I will send the commercial pricing. Okay. That I have I have spreadsheet with my commercial pricing. I will send that and I will say for the job that they're you know the the what I was bidding on because The further jobs, I mean, if we go into carefree surprise, Casa Grand, I charge a fee. And that's what I come up with. Nobody knows my fees. I mean I just go, oh, distance, I'm gonna charge you a hundred bucks more And that's something I've done since I've been with Roloff. So that's something I need to to my successor tell them, you know, like this area you want to charge a hundred bucks or this area is $125.

Chi Ejimofor
But yeah Okay. And you wait and you say you you're leaving does that is there like a timeline or is it just like an idea of I'm done at the end of December, I'm retiring. Okay, no one told me that Guys, no one told me that. Okay. Well congratulations. Uh thank you. Yeah. Are you gonna s are you st Uh you're nearby are you nearby? You're somewhere around here?

But it's not on right now, but it's going to be on. It's going to be on in a little bit. Um Yeah, teams, um, okay. So you charge yeah, I might um Okay, that'll yeah, that's uh good I mean I mean uh I'm sure Tim knows all that stuff. They you've had a comment okay. That's interesting that it's not brought up, but yeah, they have uh some they have a guy named Glenn. Have you met this guy yet? There's a guy named Glenn who who is uh I guess he's an assistant director and he's supposed he j to be fair, he just started yesterday, first day. But his his job title I guess he'll be Learning different people's roles so that they can take vacation. Specifically directors.

Wendy Byers
So he'll be Kind of sitting never I've been here, I've never taken vacation or a sick day. That's insane.

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know how well I guess yeah, you guys are wild. Um but I guess you and who is the other one? Kelly. Since you work off site, you know You're you you know it's you're you're taking calls, so it's a little Yeah.

Wendy Byers
I got three of 'em. Brandon, Wendy, Joe was and she needs this vemter flip tomorrow on baseline.

Chi Ejimofor
And you have a work phone that you use, right?

Wendy Byers
Friday.

Chi Ejimofor
I'll ask you that a second.

Wendy Byers
Please send me an address. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Do you have a is are you using a work phone?

Wendy Byers
No, it's a personal phone.

Chi Ejimofor
Wow, okay.

Wendy Byers
They just got one for when I'm leaving, so I'm working on trying to get some of my contacts transferred over.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so you have one but you don't it's not being used as the primary.

Wendy Byers
Yeah, I just got it like three weeks ago.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
Yeah. Cool. And I told you know, Tim and I talked about that 'cause I was like, Tim, you really need to get the person that's gonna take my job and a phone.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
You know, so they're not you know, I don't mind because I don't want to carry two phones. And the last company I worked with, not the last one, the one before that, they w they were paying my phone bill, but then they took my number and it pissed me off. So never again.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, yeah. No, I gotta keep my phone emergency church and state. I I I believe in that. Um I gotta figure out. But anyway, okay, so you so okay, so you do have a work phone. Um okay, so you charge you charge uh you y you quote jobs um through that website but you also directly through email. and then you charge fees, you figure it out. Um, do you get I mean, you get and you get calls uh you get calls from people that uh do do people give you work from here? I mean from the estimating or from sales or from anything? To some extent. I don't know.

Wendy Byers
Do they do what?

Chi Ejimofor
Do they give you work from here? You get work from the central office.

Wendy Byers
You know, you get a call or into I mean like Lacey and sometimes I'll send some.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
You know. But it doesn't whatever they send me, I have to call the contractor anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
So Okay, so okay. So they all they might send you uh some well, how often does that happen?

Wendy Byers
Does it happen uh often at all or Well when the when they I try and tell people to call me directly because when they go through the the co the coordinators, I don't have where it's gonna be placed. I don't have, you know It's information I need and unless they can get it right in the email, don't send it. Let me just talk to the contractor.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, okay.

Wendy Byers
So if they call me directly there's a better chance of them getting it the next day.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Oh and in general you have I guess What do you ask them and when you talk to them? You just you ask you find out where the dumpster where the roll-offs are going, how many uh What do you what do you need from them? Or what do you yeah, what do you need?

Wendy Byers
Oh yeah, I need to know the size of the dumpster, the location, the the address of where it's at. If it's if it's an exchange or something. And is it an exchange, a termination, or a delivery? You know, if it's a new delivery, we need to know placement. I need a project manager's phone number to put all this in the database
Chi Ejimofor
Uh when you say database, what do you mean by database?

Wendy Byers
Pro, pro.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay, cool. Okay, a few minutes left. Um you uh Crow. Um I haven't been trained on it yet. Hopefully at the end of the week I get some training, but do you You like you like Crow compared to the other stuff you've used? Is it the best? Is it the medium?

Wendy Byers
Is it I would ru I like box tracker better, but To try and change things around is a that's a loft, but this big of a company.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
So no, it's fine.

Chi Ejimofor
What was better about Box Tracker? Is it just the general interface?

Wendy Byers
The I liked it well here's the deal like one of my drivers is a little dyslexic and in they shouldn't let you when it's an exchange which means we take a can to the site we pick up a can Well, they'll let you put in a wrong number. And with Box Tracker, it has to be the right number. It will it will throw an error message if they try and put in a wrong number, which is nice Because, you know, we have duplicate cans sitting out there because of this reason. So and then I gotta locate 'em and try and, you know, when somebody's out there we need to change the numbers and all
Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So there's it's easier for for people to make errors because it doesn't uh i the fields aren't like exact. It's not like hey it has to be this or else. Okay.

Wendy Byers
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
And just like the scheduling on the mapping was way easier on box tracker, but you know, we we're used to this now.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So you get okay. So you get and you get calls directly from people all the time. Of course your recurring customers, people that just know you as the lady. Hey, I have my roll-off lady.

Wendy Byers
Let's just call her real quick.

Chi Ejimofor
That's a W.

Wendy Byers
Uh But yeah, I mean now the people that are calling the direct line It's automatically going to the answering service, which also is I'm gonna I'm gonna speak to Tim about that because in fact I got a text from somebody the other day that said our answering service is terrible. But um nothing is I mean Yesterday I had a wrong phone number. Last week I had a wrong phone number. So then you gotta email the answering service back. I don't know why it's not just and hopefully when the new number you know with the new phone it'll go directly to the new phone is which it should do. It should ring and then if it doesn't answer, go to the answering service.

Chi Ejimofor
Mm. Yeah. Okay. So they have okay. Interesting. Okay. So you don't you you do you get emails or some you get emails from the answering service, but you've had issues with with uh provide you know P getting them getting correct information and then and then you're having to I guess you get you have to sit there um because they they didn't give you the right information so you have to Okay
Wendy Byers
So I'm calling the contractor back anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay. So that's the work that you get from from central office. Sometimes it's from the salespeople, but it's also from the answering service and then 90% of the time it's just from people that you know or people that you've directly quoted slash emailed and they've they're in contact with you. Okay. Uh cool. Uh do um I know they were talking about getting like some email confirmation from people uh about like roll off or about what they need. Is that something that You know, do you do you I guess what um yeah, do you get invoices or emails, com or what do you get from people? Is it or is it just people are usually trustworthy and they Yeah, I guess how does that work as far as confirmations or something goes for Billy?

Wendy Byers
I talked to him on the phone, I'm like, you got it, be done tomorrow.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
They don't my my normal people don't call me. They'll call they'll text. I mean I'm sorry they don't email me. They'll call me or text me. I do get lots of textures and I respond to everyone like okay it's on for tomorrow.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. That's it. It's call and text, okay. Okay. And 90% if you were like, hey, just text me the same thing, they would just text you in two seconds And it would be easy. So getting text confirmations or something from a person is like easy. Email might is a lot for or do you think a lot of them would email or Do you use an email?

Wendy Byers
It's to me it's easier to get the you know when they call they text me, I need this container flipped tomorrow.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
You know, and that's what most of them do.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Wendy Byers
call and talk about my customers nobody I bet you I have out of all my customers database I bet you I got three people that emailed for orders the rest of them call me per or text me.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Okay. Uh okay and and uh Karen is the person who takes care of your billing? Is that Yeah. Uh how often does Karen have to do you do you inac do you have to interact with Karen that often, or is Karen just usually taking care of things and
Wendy Byers
There's never she uh she just does the bill. She has since I started there. This is the first company I've never gotten into QuickBooks with.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, that's nice. Okay. So you so you normally at the past you've you've been doing your own invoices and stuff, but h you know, here you just Okay. Uh okay. It's seems pretty simple. Yeah, I wasn't aware that you had your own your own bidding. That's that's cool. It's uh it's I don't think I don't know if anybody else is Well, I need to talk to the the Portageon guy, but I think I don't know you're the only person that's like actually super operating your own business over there.

Wendy Byers
Everybody else is taking work from the head office. I mean when Tim came on board because K you know what you're doing, just keep running it and you know con he could concentrate on other things.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
That's cool Ah, I guess is there any um just from your head, is there anything that you that like um any well you you mentioned the answering service Uh it's like some issues with the answering service. Um is there any like things where you're like these are places where I guess is there anything that would make your life easier?

Wendy Byers
Just start with that question Anything no, I mean well like I said, I wish that the calls went directly to the phones and not the it seems like if they call the the number on the container, it's going right to the answering service. Which I don't like because in fact I just told Tim we were price checking with an a new uh l company out there and they wouldn't even give me like I I said I'll tell you what Tim right there that turns me off. I'm gonna keep calling somebody else till I get a price. I'm not gonna wait for Joe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that going through the answering service, to me, it needs to go directly to the phones because I'm having to call them back. They don't know if it was the order was taken. They don't know if it's confirmed. So yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
It's gotta route. It's gotta be yeah, it's gotta yeah, okay. That makes sense. Uh so that's the main thing. Hmm, okay. Is the so the main thing is is this is the call situation. Um so before okay, that makes sense. Okay I think that's good. Uh I think that's good. When you so when you've been with the company for how long?

Wendy Byers
Oh no, it's four years now.

Chi Ejimofor
Four years, okay Uh was there another you took over for somebody?

Wendy Byers
Did you take this Jason was doing porta potties and this, so I kinda yeah, took over for Jason, I guess.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Yeah, it seems like Jason's whenever somebody leaves one one of these jobs, Jason just becomes the director of that for a little bit until um somebody else gets in there. Um Uh what was the hardest I guess I guess uh when you're transitioning from a different company. Yeah, what was the I guess was there any difficult thing about moving over When you started? Yeah. Because you've been doing this for a while, so it's just like it's just in and out. You're just doing it for some a different name on the On the paychecks, I guess.

Wendy Byers
I think all my contractors, like I don't even answer the phone desert service. I'm like, hey Tom, hey Bill. Good morning. I mean they they know me so well, like if I pick up the phone and go hi, they're like, What's wrong? Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah that's sure that's why I do like that about uh uh about construction. I mean I feel think it's about a lot of uh I'm most business I feel like. That's what I don't like about the corporatization of all these businesses. You lose You know, you gotta say I'm I'm this with this nobody knows who you are Yeah you know it's less good okay Alright, I think that's like that's all uh do I have any random other questions? So work, yeah, I know the work the way that work comes in and When uh Karen pulls the stuff directly from Crow. Doesn't need anything from you. Do they ever give you like PO numbers or something that you need to charge against?

Wendy Byers
Certain jobs that will give a PO number or job name, we just put it into Crow.

Chi Ejimofor
You put into Crow. So they don't even need to um Um nice. That okay, I think that's let me just let me just s let me just slide over my meeting notes thing just to see if there's anything else that it Uh that I g that I have in in here that maybe I forget. Uh oh oh scheduled versus like random. Um yeah, is there any So I know we have like we have jobs that happen over and over again. We pick up maybe at the same time or the same day. I guess uh what percentage of s stuff is like, hey, we're we're kind of recurring versus like
Wendy Byers
Kind of reoccurring like right now Roars one of my contractors is like we want it every Monday Friday all you do is go set that up in Crow every Monday every Friday it'll it'll automatically pick up This is it man, okay we need crow on everything. I'm just uh c I said we need crow on everything.

Chi Ejimofor
I like uh like the sound of it, yeah. I haven't done anything in it. Uh so I uh like the recurring stuff. Um, do you have any capacity like issues at all with the amount of drivers? You hire your own drivers.

Wendy Byers
I mean we've got I just hired a new driver. He's starting Monday because a guy left. And then what it's hard right now because we're we're so busy, which is amazing for this time of year by the way, because normally November December will start slowing down because of Christmas and stuff. People don't want dumpsters in their house for Thanksgiving. But um, I mean right now these guys are they're running hard.

Chi Ejimofor
So So we're we're at the you're at the not at capacity but you're like really close.

Wendy Byers
Um Yeah, yeah. So I've got an yeah, so Monday'll be better. My other full timer's back, a new guy starts And then I'm looking at hiring a part-time ra as well.

Chi Ejimofor
Is there any way to see do is there any way to kind of see that people are uh I don't know, see capacity or see like uh free time or something in Crow. I've never been in Crow yet. Is there any way to see capacity? Or do you mean do you yeah?

Wendy Byers
Yeah. Crow even has a calendar and you can go into the calendar and you can see how many runs on a daily basis we did Um, I don't normally try and give them more than like six six runs a day, depending on the area. Every driver has their certain areas they do. Um that I try and keep them as tight as possible. Um but like I mean to I mean even today look let's see my guys have one two three four five six seven eight eight runs one has nine and four of them are in Casagran You know, you have to account for the time. So he's done really good. He's already on his one, two, three, four, five. He's on his fifth run now. He's heading to Casagran. It's noon. He started at five and he still has three more in Casagran to do. So it's gonna be I d I try to make these guys be off by two one, two.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
You know, so they're not getting all the overtime too. We're not paying overtime up the S. But um right now with the driver being short, we're just balls to the wall.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And you hire everybody yourself. You they'll bring they'll they'll funnel you candidates. They'll funnel you candidates, but you do the interviewing and hiring
Wendy Byers
I used to do it. Now with the HR, they were all going through HR and then she sends me the candidates. I talk to them. Then she drug has them go for their drug test and they're offered. Okay.

Chi Ejimofor
Are we competitive in the industry, would you say? For is it easy? He knows that.

Wendy Byers
We talked about it. Wow, yeah. We need to up them a little bit. I don't think we've upped them. When I started, I upped them because they were way too low. And I think we might have upped a couple. Like we started charging We knocked it down to 21 days and after 21 days it's 20 bucks a day if they keep the dumpster. A lot of companies are doing 14. Now mind you, the contractor needs more than 14 days. But the residential people they should only give 14 days. They should be able to turn that can. And here's those are our assets. And like we're almost out of cans right now. We're so busy we're almost out of cans. I don't want to order anymore right now because the slower season's coming and I don't want them sitting at all the landfills and then the landfills go, you gotta get the cans out of here. So I've kind of been, I know a couple drivers like, Wendy, we need 40s. I go, bear with me. I'll get one from somebody else, you know, a termination. But um I mean next year we'll probably have to order more cans again. We ordered two 30s right now, but I just picked up a contractor. He's gonna keep a permanent 30. So there goes one of the 30s right out the door for the next year. But um So I don't know.

Chi Ejimofor
I heard from and then there's I guess the last thing 'cause we're at the end. Uh I heard I was talking with sales today and they were mentioning that There was it's somet i it's one of the pricing wise, they f uh f found it difficult, uh not with the roll offs in general, but they were saying that if we don't move the roll offs or if the if the contractor doesn't move the roll offs then there's like a twenty five dollar a day thing that hits and is diff and people and I know it could be a lot It's like a twenty-five day per day charge uh on the roll off so they don't move it.

Wendy Byers
In your opinion, since you've been in the industry for a while, is that actually a common thing to have or is that Well it is nowadays, yes, everybody's doing it. Yeah, everyone's doing it. And you need to because here's the deal. You give 'em thirty days, they're keeping those cans for thirty days. You give them twenty-one, they're keeping them for No, if I I have a I have a report and I try and call like every every week. I call the people and go, Hey, you're at this many days, you know. Some of 'em have a fit. I said, you can't, you know, those are assets. You can't keep them permanently. We need them. That's how we make our money. It's turning our can.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Wendy Byers
So And people just so that's like part of the game.

Chi Ejimofor
So if we add the salespeople out there, they just have to be aware of that is part of the communication is like we can't make money if we don't have this in place and this just ha they have to l have some some lines or some communic some way of communicating that I guess. Okay so I'm Have you ever met with the sal um met with the salespeople? Would you s yeah? Have you I said have you ever met with the salespeople? Have you like had a meeting all together? Okay. Yeah. It sounds yeah, it sounds like price it's uh well first of all, I mean I d I didn't know that you were doing uh for all the other people, you know, I don't know. I guess you specifically of anybody since you have so much experience and since you're doing pricing and since you're like arguing you know, ar I won't say arguing, but like ar you know Fighting with people on the phone about certain things sounds like that's like uh of anything, roll off specifically is one of the ones where it would benefit to to sit down you know every month or every couple weeks especially.
