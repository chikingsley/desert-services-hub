# Platform Options

* *Not a fit:**

* ServiceTitan - doesn't fit the trades we typically serve
* Buildertrend - overkill, too big and expensive
* Procore - overkill, too big
* Proest - overkill, too big
* Autodesk Takeoff - redundant since we already have Bluebeam Revu

* *Project Delivery:**

* FieldMotion
* CRO software
* Build Board Pro - good for managing estimates; adding things isn't great but would save time by not having to add 50% of bids into the CRM

* *Project Management & Task Management:**

* Monday.com - can do all of these things if organized correctly; won't be pretty but functional
* Notion - similar to Monday, functional option
