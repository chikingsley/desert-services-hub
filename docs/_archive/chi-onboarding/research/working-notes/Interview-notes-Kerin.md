og - contract comes through with signs, if does, need noi or dust permit (certain requiremnts for signage)

info is scattered -> contracts go out to everyone, and individuals have to figure out what's necessary

fed by contract/estimate work

signage

* maricopa country dust signage -> dust permit first (if under 5 acres), responsible party contact name + phone (should match permit) - need to match permit nad match whos onsite
* fire dept access signs 4x4 - responsible party contact name + phone + street address (should match permit) - stickers over signage if name changes
* swppp -> need NOI (needed from GC) -> if they fild for an NDC they don't need this --> usually don't change

* pinal county dust signage
usually inspectors/sales contact if there's a mismatch __ (are they checking and making sure this is in line)
get email confimration of work -> need to change dust/fire signs if super changes.
* --> when signs were being made by us, it was easy to see.
started a spreadsheet of signs that are sent out.
[supplier] Sandstorm. we have set rates for set signs now
need to check out the sign guys.
send an email that's formatted and wiht what and how many.
[request template] [request rates] -> can get signs in as little as a day. free pickup, charge for delivery
* > Kendra does billing for signs and dust.
signs shouldn't be made until permits come thorugh.
* > when install date is set, signs should be ordered.
when they go on the trip, they should ahve all the stuff in place when they go

need to figure out who is doing a dust permit - if it's another company, we should interact with them and keep track.

if project is put on hold (couple months) - need to check if anything has changed.

* if dust permit would change, we need to change it ourselves

EVA is tracking pj and swppp supplies.

Opportunity --> Billing through CRO could be setup. Rolloffs are a simpler process, PJs more difficult.
