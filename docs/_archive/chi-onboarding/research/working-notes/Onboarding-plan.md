# Onboarding plan – Project Coordinator (Chi)

* *Location:** Tempe HQ (on-site)  
* *Manager:** Tim Haitaian (with input from Jayson Roti, Jared Aiken, Kendra Ash)  
* *Buddy/Mentors:** Jared Aiken & Jayson Roti  
* *Start Date:** October 20, 2025

## Purpose

Establish a disciplined coordination and documentation function that maps current workflows, removes work from senior leaders, and improves customer experience. Chi will document the "as-is" process, propose and pilot "to-be" improvements, and deliver a 6-month rebuild of the workflow to leadership's satisfaction.

## High-Level Outcomes & Dates

- **Day 30 (November 19, 2025):** Complete end-to-end documentation of the entire existing workflow (as-is), plus two handoffs executed: dust permits → Eva and sign ordering → Eva, each with a format SOP/checklist and confirmation of capability.
- **Day 60 (December 19, 2025):** Deliver a written gap analysis and change recommendations, with incremental changes implemented continuously (prioritized to reduce load on Jared/Jayson/Kendra). Present draft KPI/SLAs for enactment at Day 90.
- **Day 90 (January 18, 2026):** Launch the first/next iteration of the workflow (to-be v1). Enact agreed KPI/SLA set and begin monthly iteration cadence (every ~30 days) through Day 180.
- **Day 180 (April 18, 2026):** 6-month objective/bonus checkpoint: Chi is designing and running a rebuilt workflow that leadership (Tim, Kendra, Jared, Jayson) confirms simplifies work for stakeholders and improves customer experience.

## Immediate Actions

### Setup Recurring Meetings

- **1:1 with Manager:** weekly for first 8 weeks, bi-weekly during month 3, monthly after
- **1:1 with Mentors:** weekly for first 8 weeks, then as needed
- **Stakeholder forum:** bi-weekly 30 minute sync (Tim, Jayson, Jared, Kendra) to review blockers, decisions and trade-offs
- **Weekly Update Email:** progress, decisions needed, blockers, upcoming pilots, risks, ideas, and open questions

## 30/60/90 Expectations

### Days 0-30 — "Learn & Document"

#### Objectives

- Map the entire current workflow for each service family (lead, quote, setup, execute, bill, collect)
- SOPs to ensure clarity on how the process works today

#### Deliverables

- **Workflow Maps V0:** swimlane diagrams + RACI for each major phase
- **Role Summaries of Intro Meetings**
- **SOPs (As-Is) for existing processes:**

  - One Page SOP Template (Purpose, When, Steps, Inputs/Outputs, Owner, Files)
  - Intake & project setup
  - Handoffs to execution systems (SWPPP Master, CRO, Dawn's file)
  - Change requests (frequency, units, routing)
  - Closeout/archiving

- **Contract Review through Execution Process (Added October 30, 2025):** Map end-to-end with Kendra/Jared. Capture key pitfalls: SOV vs estimate, certain problematic clauses, etc.
- **Project Delivery/Kickoff Process (Added October 30, 2025):** Map end-to-end with Jayson/Jared. Capture key pitfalls: safety, badging, certified payroll, timing, key contacts, etc.
- **Dust Permit Process Draft (Jared to Eva):** SOP + training checklist; Eva confirms readiness
- **Sign Ordering Process Draft (Kerin to Eva):** SOP + ordering matrix (vendor, lead times, sizes) + training checklist; Eva confirms readiness
- **Pre-Qualification Process (Draft):** incl. training checklist — define the formal process flow with Dawn: triggers, packet contents (safety, insurance, W-9, DS info), request/response timelines, storage location
- **Issues Log & Opportunities Backlog:** ranked list of waste, bottlenecks, and error types

### Days 31-60 — "Recommend & Pilot"

#### Objectives

- Build a gap analysis (waste, rework, delays, risk)
- Propose to-be workflow with a minimal viable set of changes that reduces work for Jared/Jayson/Kendra

#### Deliverables

- **Gap Analysis:** top 10 issues with root causes and proposed fixes
- **Workflow Maps V1:** simplified swimlane + ownership; clearly mark what moves to Eva or other roles
- **Contract Review/Execution & Project Delivery Management Plan (Added October 30, 2025):** Submit a simple plan for how DS could/should manage these steps (owners, handoffs, checklists, communication, etc.). Goal: reduce friction, reduce cycle time, improve customer experience. Recommend tools or templates.
- **SWPPP Narrative Binder Handoff to Eva (Added October 30, 2025):** Shift SWPPP narrative binder production to Eva (inputs, training, etc.), similar to signs and dust permits done in first 30 days.
- **KPI/SLA Proposal:** measure what matters (e.g., intake to setup lead time, clean handoff rate, defect rate at billing handoff, # of touches per job)
- **Pilot Plan:** choose 1-2 low-risk flows (e.g., dust permits, signage, pre-qual request packet) and run a 2-week pilot with baseline vs. after metrics
- **Change Log:** small incremental improvements enacted along the way (what/why/impact)

#### Standing Reviews (bi-weekly)

- Present 2-3 decisions needed, show expected impact, and request go/no-go
- Keep pilots small, reversible, and documented

### Days 61-90 — "Launch & Operate To-Be v1"

#### Objectives

- Launch the to-be workflow v1 and enact KPI/SLAs
- Establish a 30-day iteration rhythm (through Day 180)

#### Deliverables

- **Operating Guide v1:** consolidated SOP pack, templates, and forms
- **RACI & Decision Rights**
- **Contract Review/Execution & Project Delivery Process Rollout (Added October 30, 2025):** Roll out the first version of the entire process, including checklists and clear ownership. Track metrics to gauge success (e.g., cycle time, rework counts, etc.). Iterate monthly through 180-day.
- **KPI/SLA Dash (starter):** simple Monday/SharePoint tracker with weekly readout
- **Training & Handoffs:** 60-minute walk-through for each stakeholder group; attendance logged
- **Iteration Plan:** next 3 improvements with owners/dates

## Scope & Guardrails

- No billing/AR/portal ownership
- **Systems in scope:** Monday.com, QuickBooks (read-only context), SharePoint/Notion, and any PM tooling Chi selects
- **Understand execution feeds (read-only learning):**

  - SWPPP & Temp Fence: SWPPP Master File (Jayson)
  - Portable Toilets & Roll-Off: CRO is the execution system (Stephen/Wendy)
  - Water/Sweeping/other: Dawn's Master Billing File (Daniel/Kelley liaison)
