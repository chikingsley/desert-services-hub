swppp master

- -

[need to schedule]
date is install or followup date
work description - notes to field crew to do job
[confirmed schedule]

old books and signs need to be updated with a new number and sticker.

need to be able to go in and add a task to an ongoing project -> new sticker, new sign etc, triggered from inspectors
james, herve are good at customer stuff and knowing the issue. swp inspectors should be taking pictures of the issues and sending that

should put things in the quickbooks as they come up.. add teh the schedule then add to the QB

- --
the works -- project

- match estimate with contract
potentially do things in advance with email confirmation
precommunication should start with asking about the NOI

BOOK
[1] NOI (GC should start this immediately) - reqd to start [supposed to start inspections within 2 weeks]
[1] dust permit needed before everything (GC or us) - nice to have for SWPPP plan [do you have one or will we make it]
[1] SWPPP Plan (from GC) - reqd to finish [do you have one or will we make it]
[2] SWPPP Book [reqd, are you making or are we]
[2] SWPPP Signage [reqd, are you making or are we], Fire Signs [do you need and are you making or are we], Dust Signs (reqd over 2 acres, are you making or are we)
[done before or after install] inspectors will drop off (have to schedule them) -> also inspectors will start 2 weeks after we install

PHYSICAL
installation -> temp fence - compost filter soc/bmp
>
- > need email confirming job details
- > address, site contact, site details
- -

contract truing
how much of each thing (soc, rock entrance) (should be in estimate)
temp fence details (should be in estimate)

- -

are inlets installed already, is the temp fence installed - are you ready for the soc?
ready for the rock entrance?

- -

on the day of install
>
- > have print schedules OR will send to supervisor emails
- -

jayson calls day before to check if they are ready
see jayson's schedule -- > if you see rock installs, tell ocmpany and get day

rock entrance installs (trackout install) -> buy rock (dan calls), they deliver the same day -> Dalton Davis/Daniel Vargas

- they deliver next day. call day before. Dalton Davis, Daniel Vargas Backup
- should be graded, never is -> ds has to do grading, 4-6" grading, 30ft wide - 50ft long, place filter fabric on top of cut, then dump truck pours, then us tractor spreads, we charge by the hour - faster we are done the more jobs we get done, but we get paid by the hour, 2-2.5 hours -- could be done in an hour. preferrably communicated in advance that grading should be done in advance
we'll go out before teh permits - we are the first people that touch everything. -- conversation that coudl be had in advance.
Main BMPS -> (estimator knows capacity of fence, soc) supervisers/crew leads/director call first to check if ready for install (as final check). if good, team goes and installs.
done till rework -> directly from GC or from inspectors

- --

are you ready for other things -- WT and other

- -

if projects get pushed (because of a delay), it's moved to the next day. depending on priority.

take pictures in general of stuff that we dont do
if we take care of those things, then yes we will be measureing and pictures in general. gauge (james)

- no specific way of reporting the thing
- compliance pro should fix some of this because picture required and maybe adding a description is required (should require it)

aiming to have james and logan sites converted over by the first of the year. - logan is using it for 12-19 sites in tuscon.

15 sites on the 101 --
logan is spearheading the adoption of the compliance pro app.
joel is the swppp supervisor

- --

anything can be invoice/contract
rolloff/pj invoice 90%
swppp 50>
wt, st 25%>

depends on which job and the project manager

once we get a contract we know whether we will be billing by invoice (easy), by contract can submit only once a month usually how everything is done now, and they give you the dates (by AIA) now we use the platform sightline, or they use [textura,gcpay,premier procore]

they give you days, and they decide, coudl be anywhere from the 10th to the 25th

contracts are not recieved in advance of work in general
most of the time it's stuff we've submitted estimates for
wt, sw, pj, rolloff more often callins than estimates
little temp fence are callins
big temp fence are estimates
swppp are estimates

- -

usually send an email (most common) or contract or call someone (for call, they try to get an email sent) -- it can go to sales, delivery managers, jayson, kendra, jared, (dawn, kerin sometimes)
>
- > estimate section (under each customer) should be in quickbooks under customer estimates (depending on who's asking)
- > contract gets sent to contracts email
- > job gets put in - main estimate goes on the customer, not the job
- > when jared gets the contract, the job name should be put there and it should be matched up.
jared gets contracts since he sends out estimates
- > kendra does contract true up or jared does.
- > kendra puts contract in quickbooks in there. everyne should be putting all communication in there

- > random
address, job name
temp fence -> jayson and jayson gets on schedule
etc etc -> send to the delivery person

kelly gets phone calls, wendy gets phone calls -> schedule
not as much an issue but it's an issue because of audits. auditers need confirmation
- --

estimator gets contract
checks if matches (jared) if dollar amount matches -> if it doens't match he might email jayson/kendra, might hit up the customer
if it does, send to the general contracts email (everything shoudl be matching)

- -

jeff gardner (chief estimator) used to send directly to who needed it (now it goes to everyone)
>
- > should generally be checked and sent directly to who needs
- -

operations should look thorugh attached estimate to see if they are involved (project naming can be off at this point)
billing look through to sign off -> send back for changes often -> back forth finalization usually

- -

then all the stuff -> signs, dust permits, contacts, backflow etc, noi, pulling no discharge-ndc (can be in place of an noi) - if they do this, we cant do a swppp book and sign (from the arizona department of environmental quality adeq)
all the stuff kicks off when the contract email gets sent out
insurance certs -- certified controlled insurance program (ccip), owner certified insurance program (ocip) - most jobs you have cert, auto, gen liability (dawn + eva) -> have to go in monthly and fill out insurance stuff. email notifs to see when their late. bunch of different sites. new insurance company on nov 1 that do ccip/osip stuff themselves... maybe offloading to them. (natalie) -> send to workcomp and the genlliability(gl) company (dawn + eva)
noi/ndc should be done by customer -> jayson or kerin will send email asking for this (maybe kendra) -> right when we get teh contract, we shoudl ask this. narrative, swppp plans (some customers don't know they have or need a plan) - how can a plan be found (ask jared/jayson), sign, permits

- -

billing
confirmed schedule
>
- > no green (work completed that needs to be billed), yellow is questions -> put on invoice -> send at end of month if no contract, or added to and sent at end of month

- -

kendra -> billing swppp, temp fence, rentals

- -

how people get in contact
>
- > jared, kendra (edocs) most common (for contracts) -> directors
- > people call directors directly

kerin only one that touches cro

- --

- dawn/kendra - recieve payments
- kendra - textura/gcpay/procore payments

- --
