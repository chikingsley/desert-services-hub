# Overall Notes from Stickies

Work completes
- > what was done.

Jason gets contracts since he sends out estimates

Trackouts

- They are supposed to be graded before we arrive on site
- > they are not usually graded so our operators have to complete the grading before installing the trackout
- > 2 man job: CDL Driver + Tractor driver, both of whom get their hands dirty
- > this is a bottleneck since only two guys are trained to use the tracktor. there is also a big skill gap inbetween the two operators, one of which is able to do the job in half of the time
- > SWPPP laborers are too busy to crosstrain

90% of people are ready the day of for their installations
Jayson calls the day before -> Does he? (added to questions list)

We sometimes get contracts in advance of work - it just depends on the project.
In terms of scheduling, it would be SWPPP stuff + water permit stuff concurrently, followed by Water Truck, Street Sweeping and Portajohns and last would be roll-off (if a site happened to get all of our services)

Contract vs Change Order
- > if something isn't in the contract, we need to get a change order and follow up to get that confirmed and billed.
- > currently being done by contract admin/billing but no consistent day to day owner

Temp Fence is always on the SWPPP Schedule -> Temp Fence/SWPPP are basically the same service family through they are spoken about separately

"Customer Rental Master" is where we are tracking all of the physical rentals that are out. There are no amounts in the whole sheet and there is nowhere recorded how much we have out. Temp Fence changes so often, it's hard to check. Damaged fence is thrown away. Depreciation isn't being done if that's a thing.

- we rent out water ramps (to cover hoses over roadways), water donkeys, temp fencing, grates, backflows, hoses

Water meter and backflow workflows depend on the city. Depending on the city, there are different cost requirements for who will install the meter, certify the meter, install the backflow, certify the backflow. There is a list of the requirements in the "Water Meter Pricing" tab of the "Customer Rental Master 3-7-18" Excel sheet. Someone needs to follow up on this and verify that the prices are updated and correct.

We don't like water meters.
it can be complicated - is the meter public or private, depending on this ,there are different requirements. Kendra has spoken to Tim about this and he see's their point. She thinks they could still do it but just charge more for the service, maybe +$500. In general, this is a precurser to the water truck. We need a water hookup (fire hydrant), water meter, and backflow. This needs to be coordinated in advance (Kerin does this). Water hookups are normally fire hydrants. Backflows stop back pressure feeding back to hydrant. Meter/hydrometer measures the amount of water used. If a meter is installed, this implies or requires a meter permit. The specifics depend on the city. In general, if we install a backflow, we take pictures and geolocation and send to be certified by BPS backflows (for example). Specifics of backflow installation, certification, meter installation, permitting depend on the city.

Companies keep a certain amount open on every contract for multiple years. It renges from 1-15% of the contract value, 10% being the most common, 5% being the next most common. It's impossible to tell what the outstanding balances are in quickbooks because of this.

We are not currently tracking when jobs are ending
We are not currently tracking when permits or signs require renewal or updates

- if it the projects were managed by an owner, this would be a part of the pm

RETENTION
How retention works:

- GC withholds 5-10% (sometimes up to 15%) of each payment until project completion
Why it's a problem in QuickBooks:

- QB isn't designed for construction
- No built-in retention tracking

How subcontractors typically handle this:

- Construction-specific software (Procore, Viewpoint, Foundation, Sage 300 CDS, ComputerEase) has built-in retention tracking
- Schedule of Values (SOV) billing - each line item shows: previous billing, current billing, total to date, retention held, amount due
- Most construction PM software auto-calculates retention based on the percentage you set
- Better systems show: retention held per project, retention receivable aging, upcoming retention releases

Old system didn't do any reconciliations - only once per year
How were taxes done? (Tim/Don)

Certs are a whole process -> have to be done on an ongoing basis. Could be completed in prequalification but have to be managed on an ongoing basis.

Check instpections have started.

Yes, in general, we have multiple services on each project.

Kendra is the only one checking up on this and always following up (on change orders, on getting bills paid).

Outstanding/Open balance - there is no way to see this in quickbooks because of retention. Contracts generally have 10% retention and there is no way to differentiate between outstanding bills and retention at the moment.

The way that the GC likes to be paid is usually listed in the contract. If we don't know or it isn't there, we guess and send an invoice and then if rejected, resubmit the recommended route.

How the SWPPP Scheduling system works.
- > no colors means ready to bill
- > green means it's done but the work completes haven't been recieved yet.
- > pink means scheduled but not completed.
In order to bill, Kendra is creating a schedule of values and matching it up with the contract. If it's higher, which it usually is, we have to get a change order. If things are missing, someone has to follow up and see why they weren't done.

Monthly billing means sending an invoice monthly or submitting a payment via the method that the GC prefers. If submitted via one of those methods, an invoice is stored in QB and that payment is submitted via that method. Contract billing is done monthly and invoices are sent immediately if the project is by invoice. The company "Desert Services" is setup in all of those providers so to add us should be a couple clicks.

Street Sweepers are generally not booked all day but it depends on the job.

Don wants to close the billing every month to prevent changes for audit purposes but that doens't work for the way that billing is currently done. For example, he might close the first week of November when the billing hasn't yet been put in for next month.
- > one solution is to track the billing somewhere else and only put it into quickbooks when the invoice is actually sent. Not sure what happens after if they don't pay and more things get added. I'd assume just another invoice and they would stack but I'd need to check. [mo is exact on edit invoices? <- no clue what this is supposed ot mean but i wrote it.]

Who gets email confirmations of work:
Jayson: yes
Daniel: yes, sometimes
Wendy: no, just inputs directly into CRO
Kelley: no, just writes down on paper schedule
Stephen: no, new on job
