# Questions

## For Jared Aiken (Estimator)

### 1. Bid Submission Methods

When opening and filling out an estimate and updating the CRM status:

- What determines whether you email the bid versus submitting it directly on Building Connected?
- Are there other websites besides Building Connected where you submit bids?
- What factors drive the decision on submission method?

## For Dan (WT Process)

### 2. Site Walks

- How often are site walks actually occurring? **- yes, he goes to actually walk the lot washes or he'll do photos.**

__- site walks will also happen for swppp, just depends on what's needed. Herve (the inspector) or Daniel will do it

### 3. Water Truck Scheduling

- Need clarification on the scheduling process for water trucks **- calls to see what best fits them, talks to them to figure out how often they want to go. most of the time he will go walk the site. he knows the existing schedule so he'll offer openings. he'll come to dawn to put on the master + schedule**

### 4. Work Completion Process

- Need to understand the work completion steps better **- (Kelley) - send work completes from notebook weekly. his notes have "who requested", "PO number" and + timesheets.**
- *- log the hits into the master for billing and look at the notes for the PO numbers**

Kelley has an iPhone (company phone)

## Compliance & Documentation Questions

### 5. NDC (Notice of Disturbance Completion) Requirements

- If someone has an NDC, does that mean they do NOT need a SWPPP book or SWPPP sign?
- Are there exceptions to this rule?
- If they have an NDC, do we need

  - A copy of it?
  - Just the number?
  - Something else to move forward?

### 6. NOI (Notice of Intent) Requirements

- CONFIRM: The NOI is necessary to move forward (go-no-go)
- CONFIRM: Both NOI and dust permits are go-no-go situations
- CONFIRM: We need to understand if they have an NOI at the beginning because that determines whether we do a dust permit or ask for one
- CONFIRM: The dust permit is go-no-go because we need to check if they're doing it or we're doing it

### 7. Document Process Confirmation

Need to confirm the overall document process flow for NOI and dust permits.

## For Jayson
