# SALES PROCESS & ACTIVITIES - ORGANIZATIONAL NOTES

SALES FOLLOW-UP PROCESS

Historical Context:

- As of 5 months ago, there was NO follow-up on submitted bids/estimates
- Rick has since implemented a follow-up system

Follow-Up Methods:

- Combination of emails and phone calls (scope-dependent)
- Follow-up ensures estimate receipt and includes attachment of cut sheets
- Rick tracks sales activities via the Last Activity Column

Brandon and Lacey's Role:

- Original job function: Build relationships only
- Have expanded responsibilities since implementation of new process

LEAD GENERATION

Current Lead Sources:

- Maricopa Dust Permits site (Rick monitors this)
- Relationship building with General Contractors
- "Lunch and Learns" - recently started (approximately 2 events so far)

BIDDING PROCESS

Primary Focus:

- Main bidding focus: SWPPP (Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan)
- Estimators receive projects first and bid out major (SWPPP incl.)
- Superintendents or Project Managers handle local decisions (Temp fencing, PJs, etc)

Bid Outcome Tracking:
Two types of losses (so far):

1. General Contractor lost the overall bid
2. Company lost specifically to a competitor

Performance Metrics:

- Goal: 18% conversion rate on estimates
- Note: Not fully reflective as company bids on multiple projects for single opportunities

Competitive Position:

- According to Rick, bids are likely NOT being lost due to pricing

CURRENT ISSUES & GAPS

Issue #1: Lack of Standardized Sales Process

- Current process described as "loosey goosey"
- No clear handoff procedure when sales people secure a contract

Issue #2: No Inventory Tracking System

- No PM-scale inventory tracking for capacity planning
- No visibility into materials needed for new projects
- Example incident: Required 10,000 ft of fence for won project

  - Had to purchase last minute
  - Lost margin due to lack of capacity planning

- No business planning currently in place

SALES TEAM STRUCTURE

Territory/Account Management:

- Brandon & Lacey: Top 50 General Contractors (regardless of site location)
- Michael Ricks: Next 50 General Contractors
- Michael Hammonds: New prospects (accounts with no current relationship)

Activity Tracking:

- All sales team members use Monday.com
- Notes and activities logged in Monday platform

COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

New Project Notification:
When sales secures a new project, message:

- Jared
- Jayson
- Kendra

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

[Space for future planning]

1. Formalize sales-to-operations handoff process
2. Implement inventory tracking and capacity planning system
3. Establish business planning framework
4. Continue monitoring bid loss reasons
5. Expand "Lunch and Learn" program systematically
