Core CRM (Sales & Account Management)

- Contact/company/opportunity tracking
  - > if won, initiate information gathering workflow/task in CRM
  - > handoff package - handoff process after information gathering initiated
  - > prequalification package manageement
  - > billing setup (what billing service do they use, do they prefer monthly or individual invoicing)
  - > estimate/contract reconciliation task
  - > project kickoff coordination (what's needed to come onsite, safety, badging, site access)

- Activity logging (calls, emails, visits) with task reminders
  - > Estimate follow-up tracking here

- Map view for route planning and site visits
- Track what services each customer currently uses and their satisfaction
- Field Inspection Reports - Capture site visit details (what services they use, who they use, satisfaction, competitive intel)
  - > Sometimes these visits generate service requests that need action

- has visibility on all of the servicelines integrated into a project

Work Order/Service Request Management

- Capture service requests (from field visits or other sources) - things like: new sign, portapotty, fence, water tank refill, etc.
- Route requests to appropriate delivery manager (could be just email, but needs to be systematic)
- Get customer approval/confirmation before proceeding (so you can bill) - [Email confirmation & billing protection tracking]
- Track request status through completion
- Salespeople can see what work is active on their accounts (so they don't look out of the loop)

Project Workflow (specific project type only) - PM Software

- After contract is won and signed, you (project coordinator) review and break down tasks by delivery manager
- Need to collect: site contact, has site been graded yet, other readiness info
- Track these deliverables to completion
- Track documentation requirements for each project
- Communicate billing info (currently done in Excel)
- Notify relevant delivery managers of their specific work (not blast everyone)

SWPPP PROJECT MANAGEMENT NEEDS:

Work Sources

- Estimates department → bid → win contract → schedule
- Sales → brings other services (occasionally brings bid opportunities that route to estimates)

Two Parallel Tracks per Project

1. DOCUMENTATION TRACK

    - Dust permit
    - Signage (depends on dust permit)
    - SWPPP narrative + book + plan (bundled)
    - Ideal: completed before physical install so it can be delivered together
    - Reality: often delivered separately after install by inspectors or sales

2. PHYSICAL INSTALLATION TRACK

    - BMP installations: entrances, silt fencing/socks, temp fence
    - Depends on: contract finalized, site graded
    - 3-4 crews available, each can do 2-3 projects/day

Installation Scenarios (the messy part)

- Best case: arrive, site ready, install everything in one day
- Common case 1: arrive, nothing ready, reschedule entire job
- Common case 2: arrive, can only complete 5/10 items, reschedule remainder
- Common case 3: complete install, but documentation not ready, need follow-up delivery

Rework (ongoing maintenance)

- Fencing destroyed/damaged
- Silt fencing/socks need replacement
- Entrances need repair
- Dust signage needs updating (superintendent changed)

Critical Handoff

- AFTER physical installation is 100% complete → notify inspector in that territory
- Inspector needs confirmation they should start inspections (this triggers billing)

Current Pain Points

- Hard to track: what NEEDS to happen vs what ACTUALLY happened
- Communication breakdown between estimators/sales/installers/inspectors
- Rescheduling when sites aren't ready
- Tracking partial completions
- Change orders (contract vs actual scope differences)
- Making sure inspections start on time

- > confirmation email - confirmation of schedule
- > what do auditors need to see?
