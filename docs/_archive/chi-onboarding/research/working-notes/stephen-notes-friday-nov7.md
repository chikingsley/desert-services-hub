there is no policy on moving our toilets
moving toilets can cause issues when we get onsite beacasue it can bedifficult ot find out where the exact pj is.
none of hte pjs are tagged/lebbeled or asset numbered in any way
most of the time we come onsite the pjs are moved
if a pj goes midsssing, teh customer is charged allegedly.
i don't know the cost of a new unit - might be worth tracking if it was easy but tbd. look into that

the hardest part of the job is routing. a lot of the routs need adjusting and optimising. you can only optimize after assigning and you need ot optimize often.

kinda strange that you can only optimze after the fact. (my thought)

he needs this info from people

- name of the account/company
- billin address
po #
biling contact
site loctioan
name of site/project
how many phs
onsite contact info
specific restrictions
- ppe, gate, gadged, safety videos
specific requests

- hand sanitizer, howm any times service per week, specific days per week, placement onsite, date that they want it starting, estimate for end

my overall impression was that thigns were going well with him. the main things were that the CRO software isn't being used to it's full potential AND it's being misused or having issues from time to time and we don't konw why. we really need ot sit down wit hteh training people and figure out what is happenind and fix instead of jsut firefighting.

in general, he gets calls and emails from people who ened service. he will get info from them and just enter it direclty into cro. he doesnt get email or any other kind of confirmatoin from the person at this time.
