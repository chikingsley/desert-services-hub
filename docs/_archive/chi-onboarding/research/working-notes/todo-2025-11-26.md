## IMMEDIATE (This Week)

### Chi Can Start Tomorrow

- [ ] Win notification comes to Chi - start tracking where contracts come from
- [ ] Information gathering using intake checklist
- [ ] Set up personal issue tracking (Notion, spreadsheet, or Monday board)
- [ ] Start logging issues as they happen
- [ ] **Go through stack of notes** - organize and capture everything into docs

### Research

- [ ] **Conductor.is API** - Chi wants to explore this sooner

  - Can it automate QuickBooks → estimate → PDF?
  - Can it pull values from Excel and auto-generate schedule of values?
  - **NEW:** Siteline has open API - could connect Siteline → Conductor → QuickBooks

- [x] **Siteline Deep Dive** - DONE (see 1-research/siteline-research/SITELINE-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md)

  - Has open API
  - GC Pay/Textura: excellent, Procore: problematic
  - Progressive billing: yes (billed-to-date, balance to finish)
  - Security: NOT documented - must verify before proceeding
  - Already paying for it, underutilizing

## SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks)

### CRO (PJ + Roll-off)

- [ ] Schedule regular CRO vendor training sessions
- [ ] Start CRO issues list - document problems as they happen
- [ ] Go through issues weekly with Stephen, Wendy, Kerin
- [ ] **URGENT:** Capture Wendy's issues/workarounds before she retires (end of year)

### BusyBusy (WT/Sweeping)

* *Project Lead:** Natalie Richardson (Assistant to CEO / Chief of Staff) - off-site

- [ ] Get stakeholder group together: Natalie, Daniel, Kelly, Dawn, Chi
- [ ] Establish regular cadence (weekly check-ins)
- [ ] Compare BusyBusy vs. CRO - why not use CRO for this?
- [ ] Advocate for proper rollout - not PowerPoints, actual hands-on training
- [ ] Identify on-site champion who can answer questions
- [ ] Document what the manual process actually does (timekeeping + work completes)
- [ ] Verify BusyBusy can replace both functions

### Process Maps

- [x] Create Street Sweeping (Kelly) process map - DONE (see 2-deliverables/workflow-maps/specific/street_sweeping_process.mermaid)
