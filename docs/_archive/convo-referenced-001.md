OK, I guess if I’m gonna give him an update to somewhere I’ll put it in the damn LLM and you know cause I guess you remembered some stuff so but yeah what do I want to talk about yet today? Today is OK. I feel like I’m making some progress on my project. To some extent I do feel that I feel like I had a mini tiny breakthrough on the record of the Notion boards, everything is it’s really just approaching things from the story and from the story of of behavior and then working your way to them to the actual methods one of the things that I hadn’t figured out yet is I am really listen man. Well, I’m really close to this building. I mean listen I’ll be what we’re already doing this all right it’s this is the thing I mean I was going to just build our own CRM. The only thing is that it has to be performance. It has to be performance the thing that keeps happening, I will say whenever I. whenever I have a demo whenever I have an idea that this is unacceptable right whenever I have any of these things I pull it up it’s not you know and it’s slow or and it doesn’t work and something doesn’t load unacceptable like so anything that I’m all of these all the flows that all the stories that I’m telling I need these things to be tested and fucking fast as shit like fast as shit like you know and so unacceptable like honestly I don’t think I’ll be deploying anything next JS we’d probably be using we’d probably be using pages and workers but I have to figure out what I need to deploy the front end somewhere and it just has to be a man it can’t be it just can’t be like everything has to immediately in milliseconds MS it has to immediately in milliseconds go to where it is and it’s the same thing with upload file uploads we need to just figure out how to how to have that you know the other thing so I guess I’m just I’m waiting on the car right now so I’m just talking myself through stuff and bullshitting one of the things that you know it’s it’s the I don’t trying to think about the CRMCRMCRM and I’m like OK cause what? What is it? What do we need there? You know what is it that we have to track and what is the purpose of what we’re doing you know what is the purpose behind what we need and I talk with the VP today and he also didn’t really know he didn’t really know I asked him you know hey like what do you actually want to see you know cause everybody talks about well you know a in this other CRM they have an account view and on the account view, you can see all of the active projects and the active job sites and and I’m like well who cares what does that tell you what does that show you you know what does that give you about that person does that tell you anything useful that you can go and use I mean what is the place? Where is the place that that there is a usefulness and I guess just to get some feedback so we have a mix of account management and sales. OK what I don’t know what what is the cadence that normal people use for account management? I don’t know. that cadence but software like if they upsell somebody let’s track that right change order probably you know but you know they and if they pipeline something and something is coming up and that’s gotta be noted. I guess I guess it’s weird and I talk to them. I talk to them and basically you know that they go to their customer sites they go to these sites every week and they go in there and they beat their scene and they have conversations and people can rope them in. hey I need this. I need this. You know it’s kind of like rework like hate like I’m your point of contact I need an extra. Can you get changed in someone and then there’s some new stuff we’re like they’re doing some negotiation on some of the newer stuff bigger things and trying to get us on more stuff and that’s happening and it’s none of the actions are really being tracked in any sort of robust way. The only action that’s being tracked is these these surveys that are abhorrent to be honest, but they do something the survey. Basically you know they go to any all this is like more of a function of one at the beginning when we didn’t know shit but basically the survey is like who are you using for all of these different servers who are you using for all these different services and depending on who and how is your satisfaction level with whoever that is and then you can they have data on it OK so that’s somewhat useful but that’s the only sales action that’s really tracked like site like nothing else is really tracked and I’m not sure what else would be valuable. Now we talked you know he wants forecasting that’s one of the biggest thing he wants forecasting on from an asset standpoint and for my financial standpoint that was the main thing that he brought up and then for me, I want clean data coming back to me from a estimate standpoint and a project standpoint so whenever stuff gets one I wanna be able to go somewhere and everything is where it needs to be boom boom, boom, and then we can go and get it and it’s all good. I want clean data and I want a clean contact information. I want you know so that I can call people I can easily find estimate I can easily find whatever and it makes my life a lot easier and then of course to do the fulfillment fully. It makes everybody’s life easier if the data is clean and if and then I want to follow up process just to make sure that we close out open opportunities so I want this follow up process so we close out like these estimates that are been there for a long time. We need to know what the answer is after six months or so we’ll probably have a more exact thing put an SLA on it but for now it’s probably gonna be just six months. You know we follow up at eight times and six months a few calls in the last one you know and then it’s like OK close it out you know loss and so what else so that’s what I want and so and of course the business wants more money so then in that context, I shot so I’m trying so whenever I’m I’m crafting the idea for the system if I don’t have more information on whatever the CRM is or whatever the fucking thing is, then I don’t have you know what I mean then what do I even like for me from what I see they just like the map feature they like the map feature and they like the you know maybe the you know upcoming site visits where they have to go do their inspections on a monthly basis that’s like the main thing you like to be able to see the maps and go visit the stuff in the area when they’re going to somewhere that’s like something you know and that I was kind of building as a dispatch software or I’m gonna start today or tomorrow building up a dispatch software, but it’s like they could probably partake to whatever extent in that but yeah it’s like what what else do you if somebody an account management even need you know they’re not using any of the CRM features they’re not emailing. There’s no record of emails. There’s no record of calls. There’s no transcripts there’s no record of anything. It’s just fucking whatever you know and you know I would if it was me I would I would have records of everything right yeah I would have everything hooked up to the probably some CRM calls will be recorded. Everything would be in there and if anytime I called you it would be going right into there, but they don’t give a shit about it and technically at the end of the day like data is ‘s data at the end of the day of course that all you know you can analyze stuff in and and work on on on life, but on another hand of especially with an industry like this, it’s like it’s it’s it’s way more about putting in the reps and being somewhere overtime and then obviously whenever you get a chance deliver delivering yeah I’ll I’ll leave that. Let me know what you think about. about that overall.

Thought process: Synthesized CRM fundamentals with performance imperatives and industry realities.

Chi is doing a voice-to-text dump while waiting for their car, processing their thoughts about building a CRM system for Desert Services. Let me break down what they're working through:

1. __Performance requirements__ - They're emphatic that any system they build needs to be blazing fast. They've had bad experiences with demos being slow, things not loading. They're thinking Cloudflare Pages/Workers over Next.js for speed.

2. __The fundamental question__ - What is a CRM even supposed to do for them? They talked to the VP who also didn't really know. They're questioning the value of traditional CRM views (account view showing active projects) - asking "what does that actually tell you that's useful?"

3. __Current state of sales/account management:__

    - Mix of account management and sales
    - Account managers visit customer sites weekly
    - They handle requests, change orders, roping in new work
    - Almost nothing is tracked except these satisfaction surveys
    - Surveys ask: who are you using for each service, satisfaction level
    - No email records, no call records, no transcripts

4. __What the VP wants:__ Forecasting - from asset and financial standpoints

5. __What Chi wants:__

    - Clean data coming back from estimates and projects
    - Clean contact information
    - Easy to find estimates, easy to call people
    - Follow-up process to close out open opportunities (probably 6-month SLA, ~8 follow-ups)

6. __What account managers seem to actually use:__

    - Map feature for seeing sites in an area
    - Upcoming site visits/inspections view
    - That's basically it - they don't use CRM features, no emails tracked, no calls recorded

7. __Chi's observation:__ The industry is more about "putting in the reps" and being present over time, delivering when you get the chance, rather than CRM analytics.

They're asking for my thoughts on this overall situation.

My response should:

- Acknowledge the stream-of-consciousness nature and validate the thinking

- Reflect back the key insight they seem to be landing on: the traditional CRM paradigm might not fit their use case
- Help them think through what a purpose-built system would look like vs. forcing a CRM model
- Touch on the performance point - they're right that speed is critical for adoption
- Maybe help clarify the different personas and what they actually need

I should keep this conversational and not over-format since this is clearly a casual thinking-out-loud session.

I see they're wrestling with a fundamental mismatch between traditional CRM thinking and their actual workflow. Their business seems more relationship-driven than data-driven, with account managers who prioritize site visits and personal connections over digital tracking. A custom solution might look more like a dynamic field service management tool than a classic sales pipeline tracker.

The key is building something that mirrors their actual work rhythm - a lightweight system that supports site visit scheduling, quick contact lookup, and basic opportunity tracking without overwhelming users with unnecessary complexity. Performance matters hugely here; if it's not lightning-fast and intuitive, account managers simply won't use it.

````text

Alright, you're processing a lot here, but there's a clear thread running through it.

The core tension you're identifying is real: traditional CRM paradigms assume a certain kind of sales motion — outbound prospecting, pipeline stages, email sequences, call logging, activity metrics — and that's not actually how your account managers operate. They're doing relationship maintenance through physical presence. They show up, they're visible, they handle requests as they come. The "selling" happens through proximity and trust over time, not through tracked touchpoints in a funnel.

So when you ask "what would they even use a CRM for" and the answer is basically "maps and a calendar of site visits," that's not a failure of imagination — that's you correctly identifying that you don't need a CRM. You need dispatch software with a lightweight relationship layer on top.

Here's what I'd distinguish:

__What you actually need (based on what you described):__

- Dispatch/routing for site visits with map visualization
- A clean contact and account database that's the source of truth
- Estimate lifecycle tracking with automated follow-up cadence and closure SLAs
- Forecasting views for leadership (which is really a reporting layer on top of project and asset data)

__What you don't need:__

- Activity logging theater (calls, emails) that nobody will actually use
- Pipeline stages for a sales motion that doesn't exist
- Account "views" that aggregate data nobody acts on

On performance — you're 100% right to draw a hard line there. Slow tools don't get used, period. Pages + Workers + D1 or Turso for the database would give you edge-first speed. The file upload thing you can solve with R2 direct uploads with presigned URLs.

The dispatch software you mentioned starting on is probably the right entry point. Build something the account managers will actually open every day, and let the CRM-ish stuff grow organically from there if it's ever actually needed.
