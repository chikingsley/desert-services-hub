Chi Ejimofor
Uh I've got to send I've got to send to send. I've got to send an email. Uh have you matched up the contract? Send it out to contracts and I will get it signed. Okay, contracts. Wait, which one? Medical suites? Medical Suites was an error why Oh then she's the way heavy. Oh why is Herbie's um inspection going here I don't know why it's done. I think Yes, it's definitely right now. Even some tomorrow. Well, that's a taller. I don't know what that won't be. They just bridge me out when we got half too bad to make it an expensive soon. I know. I mean I've already got three boxes. Oh I should have kept putting a goal and spare box This is on the box of it was transferring to Is that how you could do that for the uh I think Like we get rid of all the time. Oh, Much. I mean the uh I wonder if anybody else can show up because of the special day. Yeah. Uh I don't think so, but let me check. It means he no, he is not. Well Well uh I mean we had an I had a I think I had another meeting with you this afternoon but um I don't think so. But uh Is it's primary for the first time. Nope, I don't see it. Um I uh my guess is I doubt it. Uh doubt he joined I it is Christmas Eve, so to be fair, but but uh

Rick Haitaian
We'll give Kendra a minute because I know she's working. I've gotten a couple of emails from her.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Okay.

Rick Haitaian
You have any plans for the holidays?

Chi Ejimofor
Um no. Maybe there's a family that I that uh I'm friends with down here. So I might I'll probably go over there tomorrow.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And then yeah, just staying in town chilling for for the I was gonna go on a trip but I it was like a little little planned a little too late. I should have bought tickets like beginning of the month or last month but it's too late but most somewhere at the end of January maybe But uh yeah, um I don't know if you had a Um I know Tavon is kind of pr protective of his uh Monday. Um in a way even though he's Uh I won't say uh what it I was what what do I want to say exactly? I I think that there's like um I think it was set up in a way and uh but I think that I think that even regardless of how you want to set it up in the future, like to move forward, it does need to be cleaned up. So that's what I wanted to do. Is really just go through.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I mean I could do that by myself, but I I wanted to just give you a heads up that I was gonna do it and or I I wanted to get some your blessing. Um The the idea of the cleanup is of course like things are linked together so it's like if there's a if there's a merge

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Then you have to like double check what's linked to this, move things over, then merge.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So that's the process. It's you know s somewhat slow. Um but and there's a there's a lot of junk in there. Um, and then there's of course like planning out the bigger system, but I was just like I'm I'm starting to like trying try to move stuff in between. Um my Yeah, my thought is that for for these people here, uh, they like to use Notion. So

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
for execution for like starting up projects and execution from this end when it leaves when it when we get a win when i it when it goes over it would probably for me I would be executing out of notion and checking off boxes and doing whatever whereas the CRM is like pure like sales you guys like run it You know, you guys are you know and I'm just I'm just that's your that's the child and even if you move to a different CRM that's like the you're stuffed.

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
And then um

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And then whenever there's a win comes over to my land and we start to do stuff with it. Um that's my separation of

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. And um so while we're while we're looking at that, we have to, you know, there's some other um

Chi Ejimofor
kind of worlds yeah and then um we'll just get everybody look at it on the paper and we'll never see what we see tomorrow and then So I can put a note here, like where's the state person?

Rick Haitaian
There there's some other projects that we we need to work on in 2026 and uh the earlier the the better.

Chi Ejimofor
Like the wheel is not.

Rick Haitaian
There's lots of projects, right, that we need to work on, but One of them in particular that I'm interested in, and so is Tim and Don, are, you know, here we are on the twenty fourth of December, and if I and if I said or they asked me

Chi Ejimofor
Before there was a lot because people were cut. Now it was like There shouldn't be that many, but I also don't want a a larger plan of just enough three up the field.

Rick Haitaian
What kind of revenue can we expect do we think that we're going to um bill in January?

Chi Ejimofor
Why don't we just do um three folders? Water colours um swift and um trees we first and then always keep them and because I have to do the time sheets every day

Rick Haitaian
We don't have that answer, right? And that's a combination, obviously, of projects that are on the books today that are that are invoicing.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. And then um oh who has to be a little bit more than is there any two versions on

Rick Haitaian
And any anticipated fall-off, project end dates, or new services added to those existing projects that are going to come on board. plus new projects that are coming on board in January, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Ah, Jordan is the nice but Yeah.

Rick Haitaian
Um, to be able to take a look at, all right, what have we got, what are what are we what is an ongoing billing look like and what are we adding to it?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So I'll get going here. And then um my trick supposed to maybe all become in here so often

Rick Haitaian
And uh give or take, obviously some amount of, you know, some things will change, like how, you know, we we put out a PJ to be

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so um why don't we do like now and do we have first again as we call okay

Rick Haitaian
you know, cleaned once a week and they change it to two. We put we put out a roll off and, you know, they call in to either have it picked up or swapped and so that's more revenue.

Chi Ejimofor
Well I think that me. I don't want to all kind of telephone.

Rick Haitaian
You know, it's little things like that. But kind of a ballpark figure. And we don't have that information today and that's a shame, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah, but not yours one. I'll expect each one to say let's see gone.

Rick Haitaian
We we should be able to predict it.

Chi Ejimofor
Chance will be deduction for once.

Rick Haitaian
We really don't at this point Um, it's a uh it's a rear rear mirror.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, and then on S E stick the H first check, possibly core.

Rick Haitaian
Uh right, we wait until around the tenth or the fifteenth of February to say, what did we build last month?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. And then so I can stick with a man Yeah, okay, y'all can I'm gonna put this in the supply cabin room.

Rick Haitaian
That's that's wrong, right? That uh you can't really run a business that way. Um and so some of that falls on accounting to you know go into the system and to tell us what are we what what projects are we billing that we expect to bill again and then the the rest of it falls on us on the sales side.

Chi Ejimofor
Can you use a folders from there? Whatever you guys know?

Rick Haitaian
on the onboarding side is to say what did what kind of new contracts have we got and and what are we going to bill them in January that that aren't in our system that we haven't been billing, right? The other piece of that that just kind of comes out of it in a natural form answers the second um real need uh that I see and that's You know, I'm placing orders for fence, right? Because we don't have any right now. But what we don't know is what fence projects are going to wrap up in January and what's going to be coming back. What PJ jobs, what roll-off jobs, right? What what is being able to look into the future and say, what do what can we expect our fence inventory to look like on January 20th? um what's coming back and what's going out and we don't know the answer to that either, right? Um we have no idea if we're gonna get back, you know, fifty thousand feet of fence in Q one. Um We have we don't have any any method of tracking any of that. So, you know, I had started to to develop at least for the projects that I was writing was uh like a bar graph that just kind of showed the project and then the service lines and that here's the start date and here's the end date. So you can then filter it by service line and and look out into the future and say what's our fence what are our fence needs going to be in um uh in in on in March, right? And what do we have and what are we going to need? So that that's a project that I'm going to need your help with.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Rick Haitaian
Um And it's and it's gonna yeah, it's gonna allow us to really manage the business in a much different way.

Chi Ejimofor
That's a cool one. Yeah.

Rick Haitaian
You know, because right now, you know, even things like we're we're paying for expedited delivery for fence. Well shame on us, right? We we should have had a knowledge that we needed the fence a month ago and and not had to put in a rush order and you know ask people to jump through hoops, right? But potentially we could have even gone out and taken a look at um who's selling fence, who's in a distressed situation and looking to get rid of fence, right? And bought their inventory of fence or or bought their you know, Portageon's or or or bought some dumpsters, you know, that somebody was looking to get rid of, right? And then we bring them in, we paint 'em and and uh and we ship 'em back out as desert services, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
I suppose it's team like and bruh.

Rick Haitaian
So anyway.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, that's there's there's a couple thoughts I have. Um I think one of the things 'cause I was working on last night I was just really pushing myself a little bit to to come up with the like I guess V Zero. Like V Zero project tracking. Like it's because I I'm I'm stru you know be honest, like it's it's struggling to Keep it like to get it it's keep it all in one place and then to actually work because it's easy to like set up an idea

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And but it's hard to actually let okay wait hey a dust permit they just rec some random person requested a dust permit How does that integrate with your grand idea of projects and estimates? And it's uh it it doesn't. I just have to do the I just have to do dust permit and then It goes to the ether. Oh, I just have to do the switch plan and now it goes to the ether. I've just I have to do the contract.

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
I just had to send a contract to to Kendra this morning and I I couldn't do any of my beautiful you know, I couldn't do my system 'cause she's she just needs it. And I'm like, all right, you know, so I'm like, all right, I have like any

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
You know, there's a mismatch of like I don't have you don't have certain you could have time, but you don't in some situations.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, right.

Chi Ejimofor
So you need to have some the in the inflows working. Um So I was pushing myself a little bit on that and to figure out like what is the what is the story? What is not the story, but what is like the flow of like Jerry comes in on Monday, he does this, this, and this, he gets a call. What happens then? Or I get a dust permit.

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
What happens then?

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
So so there's a there's a universe for asset tracking I see like that where you you know you add a You have a table and you know just asset you know whenever I get a contract, you just put it over there. Um the what the thing is the main thing is like uh that I'm trying to set up is like you yeah as much as possible, especially we're kind of a lean team, as much as possible, things have to like work on their own a little bit.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah

Chi Ejimofor
Like whenever Jared attaches an ema uh and a um an estimate to an email Or sorry, to a to the Monday it should pull out like four pieces of information. You shouldn't have to enter it, you know. It should you know, uh things like that. Um and like if there's a if there's an a if there's a trackable asset on it. You know, I should trigger something, you know, I should be like, hey, trackable asset by the way. We need to note. You know, that's it. Right now I have it on my thing to you know, we have to start asking for start end dates. We have to start actually noticing. The schedule they give us the schedule on every contract. We just kind of throw it to the side, but they give us the schedule. Now, of course, is it accurate? It's a construction project. Probably not. But they do give us something.

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
So

Rick Haitaian
At least it's something, right?

Chi Ejimofor
Right.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And you can obviously you know just like with dust permits, like they expire every year. You got the temp fence and you got the line you know you got a line item somewhere and it's just sitting there and it's got a date it's got a date on it. And then it'll it should ping you or it should ping the customer. It's like, hey, is this project still going? You know, one month before it's supposed to expire. Um but that's uh the qu the it's doable, but then the question is like how uh w one of the things I was struggling with this morning was like, all right. What's the start of this? You know, how do we get stuff into it so it's working and how do we get the reps and the feel? So that it like you know, so I I get in the you know, so it's like actually happening. So it's just it's happening, things are going in without too much friction and and then coming out

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
The money is a little bit the money's a little bit more difficult because of the separation of everything.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
PJ, RO, Zen Crow, and

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Now crow does have they call it it's it's called an API.

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Crow does have basically a way to access their information. Like you can you can ask basically the the software for their information and basically have it sent to you. Uh I haven't looked too deeply into it, but it's it they have it, so theoretically it's possible to like there's a project that you know they throw a PJ over there, it's possible to put that information into a thing and uh but of course uh even if you do that you still have to have Probably you still have to have the contract, you still have to have all the information so that you can actually pipeline it. You can get the data, but then you also have to have the you know Steven or whoever it is like Whatever what is the contract saying you know we need to put the con you know so it doesn't you know I guess just getting the the payment information or the delivery information doesn't solve

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
the problem fully. But uh anyway. It's a it's a it's a fun problem.

Rick Haitaian
And and the th Yeah, I think so too, and um and necessary because it you know, again, if uh

Chi Ejimofor
I I like I it's a it's a it'll be a fun problem to to work on, we'll say.

Rick Haitaian
what at at this point in the game right now, you know, some things are managed and handled um, you know, internally and and not w not with ease, but with with with some frustration, but as we continue to grow, right, um, it's that we're gonna stress the system. I keep saying that, you know We're going to be stressing the systems and we need to create some processes, some better processes around.

Chi Ejimofor
That'd be good for this.

Rick Haitaian
uh managing jobs, managing inventory, managing resources, including people, man, you know, like You know, w we could be in a we're sitting here talking about hiring a fourth, but um SWPPP crew, we we we we don't have any idea when we're gonna need to hire a fifth and because we just don't have access to that information, right?

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know how it has like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a It is the Pelper Yeah.

Rick Haitaian
Of what the pipeline looks like for us. Hey Jared, how you doing, man?

Jared Aiken
Geb, sorry, I just went and got my son. I'm working from home, so I got my mom and my son here, but um I I just had to update one thing on that list real quick. Um so apparently Matt Long gave Kendra access to Procore. So we can go in there and pull the sweat plans ourselves. I asked that he give me access to. So he uh he did. So I'll I'll have that today.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so okay. And that's for that's for uh Alasso.

Jared Aiken
Smart hit done. Alasso.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, cool.

Jared Aiken
Now I'll have to do the takeoff and get it back to everybody, but um I'm doing that today. I got a lot of stuff to do.

Chi Ejimofor
But yeah.

Jared Aiken
Um that I gotta get them a quote for fence. So Rick, we might also be doing fence on Alassa, which is like another 3,000 feet. No, we're gonna have to order more. And all these jobs wanna start date of the fifth. Every single one of them.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. So I got one one truckload. She was originally going to ship it on the fifth and I said I gotta have it sooner. She's now shipping it on the thirtieth. Um and last ti last shipment we they they it left their yard on the Thursday and it arrived at ours on Friday

Chi Ejimofor
Oh yeah.

Rick Haitaian
with the with the 31st, I don't really know what their plans are and what and and you know what what our plans are, like where are we gonna put it and what days are gonna get there.

Chi Ejimofor
Here's the picture.

Rick Haitaian
Are we open on the second? I believe.

Chi Ejimofor
Should be. We don't have any the only two days we're closed are 31st and

Jared Aiken
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh twenty fifth, so company.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. So um you think it's wise to put in a second truckload?

Jared Aiken
Well, I mean we're still waiting for commitment from Arco as well as Lasso. So I mean we got the contract from a lasso yesterday.

Rick Haitaian
The only part that I was just for SWPPP, right? I didn't see any reference to fence in it. I saw references to I you know additional items like water truck and you know r rumble grades and sh crap like that but I didn't see anything for PJs

Chi Ejimofor
I don't know if that's why you probably wore it actually.

Rick Haitaian
Uh temp fence, uh street sweeping, nothing.

Chi Ejimofor
Thank you for helping.

Jared Aiken
Yeah. Yeah, and that that one's been weird. They've been kind of against using us for those things. I don't know why.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, all right.

Jared Aiken
Not my account on my job to figure it out, but um he called me yesterday and wants a fence estimate, so I'll get that to him today. Yeah. Um just a side note too, so I play in uh Pool League.

Chi Ejimofor
But we can have the name.

Jared Aiken
Uh on Tuesday nights going through pool. Yep. And uh it's funny, there's this guy who's really good and kind of like mentors me a little bit. He kind of coaches me up. And last night, this like the third week, I was like, hey, what do you do for work? He goes, oh, construction. I was like, oh nice. With who? Goes Alexander Building Company. I was like, nice. What what do you do for them? He goes, I'm a pre-con manager. The pre-con manager. Like, oh, then you know who I am. I'm Jared Aiken, Desert Services. Oh, no way. Literally talked on talked on the phone with this guy like a couple weeks ago. But we've got to do that.

Chi Ejimofor
Small world.

Rick Haitaian
Talk to Aaron uh a hundred times. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because there's two Aaron Joneses um that we deal with. One of them is him, um, and the other one is

Chi Ejimofor
I know that they might have questions, which like and we had that whole barrage where they were like, I think people were very confused if that we were telling they owed that money

Rick Haitaian
Uh shit. Um there's another Aaron Jones, I think at AR Mays.

Chi Ejimofor
I just tried to explain to them like these are deductions that you've already had like data in your check.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, sounds familiar. But yeah, super cool guy.

Chi Ejimofor
They're just eology and like bad, you know, like the processes that we have to account for everything else

Jared Aiken
And uh you know it's funny he was like that's kind of funny because I just had a meeting yesterday, so like

Chi Ejimofor
on their check to show that we are getting a special treatment or to like the process and so or that they didn't get any kickbacks as well as to be able to try to track on

Jared Aiken
We give our supers the go-ahead to do whatever they want, and I put a cost basis in there. So he used to tell me he uses 55 to 65 cents per linear foot for temp fence.

Chi Ejimofor
It has to be justified for both.

Jared Aiken
But he was telling me pretty openly, he goes, you know, pretty girl walks on a site, wants to tempt fence.

Chi Ejimofor
So if we have to show the tax trail or if we have to show any other deductions for their testing yet. I tell you that should I check for like my poor pay or my benefits?

Jared Aiken
That's what they go with. And it doesn't matter what it costs because they don't actually care.

Chi Ejimofor
You got a party plan that I got for me to go to the certified job.

Jared Aiken
But we're doing audits on it right now and going through. And some of these guys have just like, don't miss the easy ones.

Chi Ejimofor
simplified the process.

Jared Aiken
Fence is an easy one. You know, PJs, that's an easy one.

Chi Ejimofor
And again, it's already when I asked about we're not telling people that they're just saying I'm excited about the consistor.

Jared Aiken
Let's not miss there. And so he's like cracking down and doing audits on all of 'em.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. It's going to be a good thing. And I extra pay

Jared Aiken
Yeah. So yeah, pretty pretty interesting conversation.

Chi Ejimofor
Um I think that we have a week to do that's the end reach.

Jared Aiken
Good guy to know.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh, excellent.

Rick Haitaian
Really interesting.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. So that was kind of a good thing, but I know they would reach out when we had them signing mass those kind of you know but

Rick Haitaian
Um oh no, I'm sorry, the other Aaron Jones works at Guthrie

Chi Ejimofor
Well but that's gonna spend so you can just right to control the role.

Jared Aiken
Oh okay.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. Nice. Yeah, but I got uh I got fifty emails in here back and forth between me and Aaron Jones at Alexander.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So that don't follow the strip. But Um can we say about winter?

Rick Haitaian
Nice. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
It's not the best of all, it's like this.

Jared Aiken
Um, but yeah, Gee, that's like the only update that I have is we got we're gonna be getting that plan back today and I'll get the takeoff done.

Chi Ejimofor
It's like snake finishes meeting things and now it's fit. Oh yeah, so it's I'm in this circle with this

Jared Aiken
Um but other than that, I got just like a few well quite a few last minute estimates to get out.

Chi Ejimofor
they rejected all of them and then they rejected the title, which are like okay. But now I think I can't listen to title until they delete them.

Jared Aiken
Rick, I saw your emails last night, but haven't really got a chance to get around to it yet.

Chi Ejimofor
I can access the delay

Jared Aiken
So

Chi Ejimofor
I'm like, oh, just a story.

Rick Haitaian
I'm gonna hop on those incoming call list.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm just story full of time.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, I'll try to clear those up, but my gut tells me that a lot of people aren't gonna answer, so

Chi Ejimofor
I gotta put these um the ones

Jared Aiken
Unfortunately, it'll probably be a task for today as well as uh after New Year or after we come back.

Chi Ejimofor
That are empty? I just put it right by my uh cracker right in there. Oh, okay. Okay. And so if you have any, you can add it there, but if I if I have some, you'll leave it there.

Rick Haitaian
A couple of them you might be able to work on. One of them he said um uh said he already sent you the plans.

Chi Ejimofor
And it's always in the signed. But I want to say junior, wasn't junior on this project too?

Rick Haitaian
Um

Chi Ejimofor
Well, we didn't have any other two working.

Rick Haitaian
Sending over the plans to Jared. That was from Jason Clonk at TLW.

Chi Ejimofor
Yes, we're gonna call it stuff.

Rick Haitaian
So so some of them you'll be able to get to today, but if not, and then do you clear them out when you're done?

Chi Ejimofor
Oh okay, right. So first I was gonna keep uh the one that was gonna be all the time.

Rick Haitaian
What are you Do you either close them or send an email to Upwind to for those girls to close it?

Chi Ejimofor
I don't break it.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, I just close them myself now.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, okay.

Chi Ejimofor
So IT and the layouts can't draw it like

Jared Aiken
All right. All right, guys. Well I'm gonna get to it. I got a busy day at uh

Chi Ejimofor
Well, I wanted to show you this real quick. I was I was gonna see I I I mocked this up and I was gonna see if you're interested in me continuing it. Um so I have uh you know about the quoting thing I was making. So that's interesting. But what I was working on in addition um is this uh where I just threw it together like A few days ago. Uh I'm just gonna pick a random one. Doesn't really matter, but you'll see the the point. Um I was trying to uh 'cause you have to go to like three softwares for the takeoffs. Um oh I hope it's not broken. Oh, I hope it's not broken. Yeah, but he do Okay, okay, good call. Okay, wait one second. Well, let me let me use my my my s my It's probably a too big of a thing. Um I was mocking up this uh takeoff software. Man, man, why do all my things always break whatever Whatever I have a demo. It's ridiculous. Um but anyway well. One second. Maybe we'll we have to exit some stuff here.

Rick Haitaian
Do you do you guys need me?

Chi Ejimofor
The idea should be a little bit more.

Rick Haitaian
Do you guys need me for this conversation?

Chi Ejimofor
No no, I just I something real quick.

Rick Haitaian
No. Yeah, okay. All right. All right, listen, Merry Christmas, both of you. Hey too.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, you two cheers.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. All right, bye.

Chi Ejimofor
You look at the ingredients on a store loaf. Okay.

Rick Haitaian
What does it do? It does take off?

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah, like the th like it basically the same thing that you do in um in your you know in Bluebeam, it should it does the same thing.

Rick Haitaian
Review

Chi Ejimofor
Uh where you can you count you know it it gets the scale, sets the scale, you can you can count the things and you can draw and then you can export it directly to the uh You know, directly to the quote inside of you know the I have the quoting thing and then you just move it, it just goes directly in.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But uh Yeah, for whatever reason we're made to try to upload a smaller thing. Okay.

Rick Haitaian
This is the best permit.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, so for example, okay, it's a dust permit, but theoretically you can imagine this is a drawing, so you could set the scale and basically you can draw uh Just like uh you know, just like whatever. And it has the you know, right the right down there, the uh the linear feet, count up whatever, uh rumble greats, whatever it is. Rock entrance and then theoretically you can you know I it's not can it's not fully connected up right now but well it is partially yeah

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, I get the idea, but then it pulls it all over.

Chi Ejimofor
Pulls it all over. So theoretically like you'd have a a link to some you'd have a link. I'm trying to figure out the connection to Monday to make it like how what's the e how is the what's the easiest way to get into this and then just to move into the thing.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But theoretically you do that and then you and then it goes right into the the quote.

Rick Haitaian
I like that.

Chi Ejimofor
You you add the extra things you you need.

Rick Haitaian
Yep.

Chi Ejimofor
You choose the customer and send it up and then send it off and it's done.

Jared Aiken
They just got it sound out. Yeah, that that's pretty cool. Uh I think there's obviously like a lot of tweaks to make to it, but um like a lot a lot of potential there.

Chi Ejimofor
There should be. Okay. Of course, hella tweet. That's what I was like. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
Or just automatically puts it on there and uh Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
So other than that, that's I know I have to go bend that with some water wraps.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, that'd be cool. We could put ways to mess with that.

Chi Ejimofor
Um speaking of Abernap here, we're not on scale. Yeah, so it obviously needs to you know Big PDFs, it needs to work with the these huge PDFs and not not crash or whatever, but um and then how to get into it easily, but Yeah, that's uh that's uh that's one of the things. So just wanna show you that, see if you're interested. I um I'll probably work on it a little bit over the over the little break and hopefully have a little bit of a I think the main from from what I understand from your workflow you have like a few starter templates that you kind of work from and then

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
And that's the main thing. So but even with the takeoff, like you would you could enter in whatever and then if you picked one of the templates you could just get to running, I guess. I filled it up though I filled it up on Monday.

Rick Haitaian
Well we just skip all the templates and we can just do um you know the only reason why it is

Chi Ejimofor
Well we were on schedule three times three with that out and out you and then it changed.

Jared Aiken
Labeled SWPPP estimate, tempfense estimate, miscellaneous estimate is for organization and clickbooks.

Chi Ejimofor
So who else did objects? Okay.

Jared Aiken
So so it doesn't necessarily need to say that.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jared Aiken
It can just say uh services estimate from And then uh, you know, in Monday, because it's gonna be routed directly to Monday, in Monday we have the service line picked out.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay. Uh there are these uh Yeah, it's got to be fine. Oh god.

Jared Aiken
You know, we have SWIPS, temp fence, whatever.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. Well hit.

Jared Aiken
So, you know, theoretically anybody can sort it by just 10 fence and look at it and find the 10-fence ones that doesn't gotta have the words on there, which would be better.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh. I don't know what site you know I I've got what Calvertville instead of Market Street. Market Street? Yeah.

Rick Haitaian
Um but yeah, you know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
I see. So even one of them. I don't well one of the bigger there was a bigger yeah, I was gonna say there was the TF, well there's a it's like a that's a whole organized I don't even why I am not even touching that with like The way that everything's organized. I mean I was just gonna keep the whatever the TF that you have before, even though technically if you add the you know, change the line item.

Jared Aiken
Yeah. I do that for me, but also if you look like six cells to the right, there is service lines, and I usually pick temp fence there too.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Jared Aiken
Sometimes when I'm doing my bid, I don't look at that service lines column.

Chi Ejimofor
And um who called it

Jared Aiken
That's more for like reporting than for my actual job.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Daniel said uh uh Gary, I think Gary said by me, and then I went and did it.

Jared Aiken
Um one thing to try to keep in mind as you work on that is like grouping.

Chi Ejimofor
And this was yesterday? Yeah. Yep. I did Maris first and then

Jared Aiken
So I would like it if we're gonna go down that road.

Chi Ejimofor
I went and did that a second. Okay.

Jared Aiken
for like all SWIFT items to be grouped and then subtotaled.

Chi Ejimofor
No, I guess you need to find out that

Jared Aiken
And then if I add PJ stuff, I want the I want that grouped and subtotaled. So that You know, when an estimator is going through the the bid, the GC, they can clearly see that SWPPP is right here, PJs is right here.

Chi Ejimofor
So dramatically

Jared Aiken
That way they don't see the big number at the bottom and get scared.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep.

Jared Aiken
You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
That makes sense. Yeah, that's that's easy. Uh it's already grouped, but just need to add the subtotal.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, because they usually don't read it line by line. Yeah, they don't read it line by line.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah.

Jared Aiken
They just they'll read it like the big bullet points, you know.

Chi Ejimofor
Super name, Chase? I do not, bro. Right now I had it uh and that's right now I have it like I had it split by like SWPPP compliance like and then I'd SWPPP BMPs or would do you would it would that be nice or is it like you want age all together and SWPPP one block

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Jared Aiken
I I like that. And for you know, here's the thing is I would imagine from this

Chi Ejimofor
Okay.

Jared Aiken
We're gonna be able to set up some sort of one trigger and then automatically route it to whoever's job needs to do what.

Chi Ejimofor
And I wonder if it says um yeah, that might have been all right. Right.

Jared Aiken
You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
I mean at the very end, yeah, f especially what the yeah, because the the the dream is yeah, once you know

Jared Aiken
Like

Chi Ejimofor
The once uh the dream is to for those for the guys that are just out and you know just delivering stuff in crow and doing whatever, it's like they still have like at least a one They still route it through here and then it's like hey go do whatever you want but like at least put it in um and then do whatever you want after

Jared Aiken
Put it in here. Yeah, but once you click one, like you could automate it to where

Chi Ejimofor
But you know, I think we'll big out some programs and things like that.

Jared Aiken
Now it's putting it on the desk permit list. It's now requesting the split plan if it's on there.

Chi Ejimofor
Um, yeah, that's what that's what I'm saying.

Jared Aiken
Um it's telling Jason that he needs to install CompostSock.

Chi Ejimofor
work we decided about that.

Jared Aiken
Get the narrative done, blah blah blah. You know, there should be a list for that too, like all the narratives.

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, which I should ask you guys, I know I've listened to this work equally.

Jared Aiken
And like, do we have a plan? Yes or no? That way I can see it.

Chi Ejimofor
Um

Jared Aiken
That would be helpful actually really helpful um to see the narratives that Jason needs to do and then the if he's got a plan or not because then I could just go in there and clean that list out and get him all the shit he he needs.

Chi Ejimofor
You guys did some lot washers. No, that was a lot washer you did do. Also, but it was it was actually right over here on What else writing like Ryan?

Jared Aiken
You know what I mean?

Chi Ejimofor
Last week I don't write.

Jared Aiken
But um yeah, no that's way down down the road.

Chi Ejimofor
Oh last week. Last week, I don't write it.

Jared Aiken
But yeah, I I like it. I think that could be uh

Chi Ejimofor
I had one in the morning and then and then never met up against

Jared Aiken
really valuable, obviously. Now you're talking about creating technology that's, you know, ours like it's like a proprietary technology that we use and that definitely puts us ahead of the game and scalable.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. That's why I was just trying to because I was sh I was telling uh Rick the one thing I was trying because I was I have like I had of course different ideas of the last couple months But every time I have an idea, you know, every time you try to do something, it's like the real world like kinda interrupts it and you're like, Well so yeah, you have I'm really so like the new my new kind of thing is like okay

Jared Aiken
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
I'm really thinking about like literally somebody sits down, this happens, this happens, this happens, then then how does this work with what I'm if I'm making something or if there's a system, if this random thing happens, this random thing happens, this thing happens, how does how is uh how is it able to work? Is it able to uh exist within the universe where it's like you just got a random call or you know, there's a random I just got an email about a dust permit.

Jared Aiken
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
How does the project system work when I just got a random email about a dust permit? Yeah, it's like I know what to do personally, but how does like The tr how do we have the tracking and all the stuff? How do we have the tracking, the money, the estimate and everything working together and then communication? 'Cause even me I'm still d I'm dropping, you know, communication, you know, I don't have even today I had to just send out the contract email. I hated I to send this raw contract email. I'm like, this is awful. You know, I can't do any of my

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
My mat many well not that my um my stuff is doing much right now, but it's like I can't even do my formatting because I don't have time you know they need it So alright, here it is.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh so I'm like, alright, we'll need to so that's what I'm trying I'm that's it m everything now is like really trying to really have that in mind, the actual Uh use the s the story that you know the story as you're going through the day is like does it does it work with the s actual real story?

Rick Haitaian
Right.

Chi Ejimofor
Um so that's that's the yeah.

Jared Aiken
Yeah, is it usable? Is it like is it usable or is it technology that we're creating that people are just gonna find ways to bypass?

Chi Ejimofor
Okay, on this law watch how many traps. Exactly.

Jared Aiken
Does it make does it make our job easier?

Chi Ejimofor
And it's like if Yep. It's like anything that's like anything yeah that's that's exactly it because I'm like I find a bunch of things and it's like it's

Jared Aiken
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh you get to a certain point, but then you're like I still have to go and manually do XX and X and it's like

Jared Aiken
Right. Is it easier to just send an email?

Chi Ejimofor
Uh two trucks and four laborers.

Jared Aiken
Yes, right off the bat, it is. I mean, it doesn't get more simple than saying, hey, Jason, install this.

Chi Ejimofor
Yep. Same time? Same time, yeah.

Jared Aiken
But on the back end, when you think about everybody involved who then has to find that email, who has to reference that email and communicate about that email, then it becomes, okay, maybe that's not the best way.

Chi Ejimofor
Waterble with a two K water was a four K. Okay. That should have been it. Right. Just like saying hey,

Jared Aiken
Like maybe that quick two-second email is not actually easier than taking five seconds in a system and plugging it in for everybody to see.

Chi Ejimofor
Right. That's that's where the and that's the extra and that's the extra bit where it's you know, but everybody has yeah it's hard to obviously uh

Jared Aiken
So

Chi Ejimofor
When people are frustrated you're like you you have to it is what it is.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah, yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But yeah, that's a good point where you it really yeah, in order for everybody and the future to be able to see this and Two word to be it's like I really need to send it this way. I have I I really want to send it this way. But sometimes you gotta take the short you have to do what it is

Rick Haitaian
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
But anyway, so I that's that's one of the that's the bigger thing that I'm working on for you guys uh in the estimating and uh and then there'll be a lot of smaller stuff.

Rick Haitaian
Do it the right way. Alright now. Well I got I got a rule. I like it.

Chi Ejimofor
But all right, we'll talk.

Rick Haitaian
All right.

Chi Ejimofor
Cheers.

Rick Haitaian
Hey uh is the file are the files live?

Chi Ejimofor
It is syncing. Uh it is syncing everything. The so the SharePoint is live. Wait, do you okay, so this is one thing I didn't I didn't remember. I know Tim said something in the em in the uh the meeting I completely forgot. What did he say for the folder structure? He said it was the contractor, then the then the

Rick Haitaian
Contractor, and then the project, and then all the files.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. Cameron? Yep. Okay.

Jared Aiken
Like it would be nice for it to be able to like parse through all the uh you know what you maybe could do is um

Chi Ejimofor
Oh right here. I've never seen a rope. Yeah, I can see it. G-Con? Yeah, I'm gonna see him. Oh wasn't he at uh wasn't he at WD? He was, but now he's at G Con

Jared Aiken
Shoot, I don't know how that would work.

Chi Ejimofor
I want to say I mean SharePoint SharePoint has metadata, so I'm I'm I'm putting stuff into the metadata columns. I'm at least putting something into them. No, no, no.

Rick Haitaian
Yeah. Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Uh yeah, it's like does it you know underneath of the folder, so it's like, yeah, does it make sense?

Rick Haitaian
Right, Brad.

Chi Ejimofor
Maybe, maybe not. But but kinda does.

Jared Aiken
Well you don't really need the folders. I mean if you type in Wilming then and it pops up everything with Wilming, then what's why do you need the file?

Chi Ejimofor
Then you're good. I think it was a class I have.

Jared Aiken
Yeah.

Chi Ejimofor
Yeah. So that's it'll it'll be the thing is he was having trouble with that.

Jared Aiken
All right. Well I I do I gotta I gotta roll man sorry I could talk about this all day but I gotta get to work.

Chi Ejimofor
No, yeah, you're good. Alright, yeah, but that is live and uh yeah, good good luck, have fun.

Rick Haitaian
Alright. Awesome.

Chi Ejimofor
Cheers.

Rick Haitaian
Talk to you later. Bye.

Chi Ejimofor
Something wealth and cat. I clock in and I flock out
