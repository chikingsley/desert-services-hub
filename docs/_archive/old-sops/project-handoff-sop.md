## What Delivery Managers Need (Confirm with Each)

Before finalizing this SOP, have a 10-minute conversation with each delivery manager:

- "When I hand off a project, what do you need from me?"
- "What format works best - email, call, both?"
- "What's usually missing that causes problems?"

Update this SOP based on their feedback.
