# Problems to Solve

Captured from brain dump (Jan 2026). These are the real issues, not theoretical.

---

## Immediate (blocking daily work)

- [ ] **80+ emails in inbox** - no system for processing, things getting lost
- [ ] **No project template** - every new project starts blank, have to remember what to do
- [ ] **Forgetting basic stuff** - dust permit billing, emails, QuickBooks setup
- [ ] **Interrupts killing productivity** - can't complete tasks, whole week goes by

---

## Process Gaps (why things fall through cracks)

- [ ] **Black box internal contracts email** - send contract, no visibility on what happens after
- [ ] **No single entry point** - work comes from DocuSign, forwarded emails, POs, random requests, directors calling customers
- [ ] **Directors bypass process** - call customers directly, schedule work, then ask "where's the estimate?"
- [ ] **No handoff tracking** - don't know if operations acknowledged, if work started, if installation succeeded
- [ ] **Estimator data not clean** - documents not in right places, estimate vs contract mismatches discovered late

---

## Visibility Gaps (nobody knows)

- [ ] **No asset tracking** - how much fence do we own? What's rented out? Where is it?
- [ ] **No installation verification** - did the SWPPP install actually happen? Only in director's Excel/brain
- [ ] **No cross-service visibility** - same customer might have SWPPP + porta-johns + roll-offs, but no way to see that
- [ ] **Scheduled values not tracked** - director has Excel sheet, nobody else can access

---

## Tool Fragmentation

- [ ] **Monday.com** - estimates/sales use it, everyone else hates it, but data is there
- [ ] **SharePoint** - historical docs, people can't find things
- [ ] **QuickBooks** - financial records, "sucks dick" (user's words)
- [ ] **Notion** - user trying to make it work for project tracking
- [ ] **Email** - where everything actually lives

---

## Org/Role Issues (harder to solve)

- [ ] **Not actually a project manager** - middleman who formats contracts, doesn't own anything
- [ ] **No authority** - can't force directors to follow process
- [ ] **Entry-level salary** - doing PM work without PM title/authority

## What We're Doing About It

### Today
1. Make Notion project template work (checklist embedded)
2. Process inbox - contracts first, then dust permits
3. When sending to internal contracts, manually follow up with actual people

### This Week
- Clear inbox backlog (contracts + dust permits only, no backfill)
- Track what we sent and follow up

### Later
- Figure out how to get visibility into the black box
- Asset tracking
- Cross-service visibility
