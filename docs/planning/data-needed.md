# DATA NEEDED BY PROCESS STAGE

**Purpose:** Minimum critical information required at each stage of the project lifecycle to eliminate back-and-forth, delays, and errors.

---

## 1. ESTIMATING / BID STAGE

**Minimum Required:**

- Account/Customer/GC name
- Project name and address (Cross-streets + Coordinates)
- Site contact (PM/Super) name, phone, email
- Estimated start date
- SWPPP plans (upload to SharePoint)
- Dust permit requirements
- Special site requirements (OSHA, PPE, access hours, badging)

**Where it goes:**

- Estimate in QuickBooks
- Plans in SharePoint "SWPPP Plans" folder
- All project info documented before sending to operations

---

## 2. CONTRACT AWARD / HANDOFF TO OPERATIONS

**Minimum Required:**

- Contract matches estimate (dollar amounts, line items verified)
- NOI (Notice of Intent) with ADEQ number (for SWPPP)
- Dust permit (or confirmation customer pulling their own)
- Site contact name, direct phone, and email
- Project start date and timeline
- Water source availability (hydrant/meter/backflow for water trucks)
- Email approval to proceed

**Insurance Verification (BEFORE signing):**

- Insurance requirements extracted from contract (GL, umbrella, auto, WC limits)
- Limits verified against Desert Services current coverage
- If excess/umbrella requirement exceeds $4M: contract revised or exception approved by GC BEFORE signing
- COI requested from WTW with correct holder info and additional insured requirements

---

## 3. INSTALLATION / SERVICE DELIVERY

**COMMON TO ALL SERVICES (collect once):**

- Email approval (100% required for billing protection)
- GC name, job site name, address
- Site contact (PM/Super) name, phone, email
- PO number (always ask, even if not volunteered)
- Start date and timeline
- Expected duration
- Special site restrictions (PPE, gate access, badge requirements, safety videos)
- Placement location onsite

**SERVICE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**

**SWPPP (in addition to common):**

- NOI and dust permit status
- Is temp fence already up? (affects sock installation order)
- Are inlets installed yet? (if no, schedule for later)
- Is rock entrance area prepped? (graded and cleared)
- SWPPP plans location (SharePoint)

**Water Trucks/Cleaning (in addition to common):**

- Water source confirmed (hydrant with meter/backflow or water tower)
- Pictures of site (requested for 85% of estimates)
- Level of dirt/cleanup assessment
- Equipment/truck access verification
- Hours estimate

**Roll-Offs (in addition to common):**

- Size of dumpster (10, 20, 30, 40 yard)
- Type: Exchange, delivery, or termination
- Expected duration on site (overage fees after 21 days)

**Porta-Johns (in addition to common):**

- Billing address (if different from site)
- Billing contact (if different from site contact)
- How many units needed
- Service frequency (times per week)
- Specific service days
- Hand sanitizer requirements
- Estimated end date

---

## 4. WORK COMPLETE / BILLING

**Minimum Required:**

- Quantities installed/delivered (specific measurements: lineal feet, unit counts, etc.)
- Time on site (start and end times)
- Date(s) of service
- Any issues or additional work performed
- Photos (for deficiencies/rework)
- Certified payroll jobs marked (if applicable)

**For Roll-Offs:**

- Can number (must be accurate - prevents duplicate cans on site)
- Exchange vs. delivery vs. termination
- Days on site (overage tracking after 21 days)
- Any damage to can or property

**For Porta-Johns:**

- Unit location/placement (units often get moved by customers)
- Service completed (date/time)
- Any issues (damage, missing units, access problems)
- Hand sanitizer refilled if applicable

**Process Gaps:**

- Handwritten work completes difficult to read (SWPPP crew work completes, WT+RO timesheets)
- Street sweeping tracked on paper notebook, transcribed weekly (difficult to read)
- Roll-offs: Incorrect can numbers entered in CRO (system doesn't validate)
- Porta-Johns: No asset tagging/labeling system (can't identify specific units when moved)

**Inspector Gaps:**

- Inspectors often don't provide measurements (e.g., "fence down on east side" without lineal footage)
- Photos not consistently attached
- Multiple site visits to same location not documented separately
- Creates delays when operations needs to quote repair work

**Inspector Requirements (to prevent gaps above):**

- Measure before leaving site (lineal feet, quantities)
- Take photos of problem area
- Email superintendent on-site with measurements and photos attached
- CC operations (Jayson)
- Get email approval before leaving

## 5. CHANGE ORDERS

**When Discovered:**

- During billing: Work completed exceeds contract amount
- During billing: Work completed not on contract at all
- During operations: Customer requests additional work

**Minimum Required:**

- Description of additional work
- Quantities (how much over contract?)
- Pricing/cost impact
- Email approval from customer
- Updated contract/change order signed

**Current problem:**

- Discovered too late (during monthly billing)
- "To me it's always a surprise"
- Should know BEFORE work performed
- Need project managers to track scope changes proactively

---

## 6. PAYMENT / COLLECTIONS

**Minimum Required:**

- Email approval for all work (verbal agreements lead to non-payment)
- PO number when available
- Contract/invoice copy
- Work complete documentation
- Lien waivers signed
- Insurance certificates current

**For contract billing:**

- Schedule of values established
- Retention percentage (10%, 5%, 7.5%, varies)
- Platform (Textura, Procore, GC Pay, Premier)
- Billing window dates (typically 20th-25th of month)
- Submission date tracked

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Email approval required for everything** - protects billing and collections
2. **Contract must match estimate BEFORE operations** - eliminates reconciliation delays
3. **Complete information packet on handoff** - no hunting for NOIs, dust permits, site contacts
4. **Photos are mandatory for deficiencies** - "pictures are a thousand words"
5. **PM/site contact collected at bid stage** - enables immediate post-win outreach
6. **PO numbers always requested** - even if customer doesn't volunteer, always ask

---

## MOST CRITICAL GAPS TO FIX

1. **Sales-to-Operations handoff:** No notification when projects won, missing PM names/addresses/start dates
2. **Contract vs. Estimate reconciliation:** Happens too late, should be done before operations receives
3. **Inspector deficiency details:** Missing measurements and photos create bottlenecks
4. **Work complete documentation:** Illegible handwriting, missing information requires follow-up
5. **Change order timing:** Discovered during billing (too late), should be identified before work performed
6. **Roll-off can number validation:** CRO allows wrong numbers, creates duplicate cans on sites and tracking chaos
7. **Sales team missing critical info:** When passing leads to operations, often missing placement, PM contact, urgency
8. **Porta-John asset tracking:** No tagging/labeling system makes it difficult to locate moved units or track missing inventory
