# Fire Access Signs for Construction Sites

## Desert Services Reference Guide & Intake Checklist

- --

## Overview

Arizona fire codes require construction sites to have fire apparatus access roads identified with signage **before combustible materials arrive on site**. This is separate from SWPPP/stormwater requirements and falls under the International Fire Code (IFC) Chapter 33.

Since Desert Services is already mobilizing to construction sites for dust control, SWPPP, temp fence, and other services, fire access signs represent a natural add-on that solves a compliance gap most general contractors don't address until a fire inspector flags it.

## When Are Fire Access Signs Required?

| Trigger | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Before combustibles on site** | Fire apparatus access road must be in place AND signed |
| **All construction/demolition sites** | Approved vehicle access for firefighting required |
| **Access roads >150 ft** | Must have turnaround provisions, marked accordingly |
| **Any fire lane on site** | Must be identified to prevent obstruction |

* *Key Point:** Signs are required during the construction phase, not just for the finished building. The fire marshal can stop work if access isn't properly established and marked.

## Placement Requirements

### Where Signs Are Required

| Location | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| __Site entrances__ | Signs at beginning and end of fire lane, both sides |
| __Along access roads__ | Spaced no more than __50–75 ft apart__ (varies by jurisdiction) |
| __At turnarounds__ | Mark dead-end access roads >150 ft |
| __Building approaches__ | Within 150 ft of all exterior building points |
| __Intersections__ | Directional signage if site has multiple routes |

### Jurisdiction-Specific Spacing

| City | Maximum Spacing |
|------|-----------------|
| Phoenix | Per fire code official approval |
| Scottsdale | 50 ft maximum |
| Gilbert | 200 ft maximum |
| Mesa | 75 ft typical |
| Chandler | Per IFC (75 ft) |
| Tempe | Per IFC (75 ft) |
| Glendale | 75 ft typical |
| AZ State Fire Marshal | 75 ft maximum |

__Safe Default:__ Use 75 ft spacing to comply everywhere.

- --

## Estimating Sign Quantities

### Quick Formula

```text
Minimum Signs = (Entrances × 2) + (Access Road Length ÷ 75 ft) + (Buildings − 1)

```text

### Detailed Breakdown

| Factor | Signs Needed |
|--------|--------------|
| Each site entrance | 2 signs (one each side) |
| Each 75 ft of access road | 1 sign |
| Each additional building | 1–2 directional signs |
| Each turnaround/dead end | 2 signs |
| Each gated access point | 2 signs |

### Example Calculations

__Small Commercial (single building, one entrance, 200 ft access road):__

- Entrance: 2 signs
- Access road: 200 ÷ 75 = 3 signs
- __Total: 5 signs__

__Medium Subdivision (3 entrances, 800 ft total access, 4 building pads):__

- Entrances: 3 × 2 = 6 signs
- Access roads: 800 ÷ 75 = 11 signs
- Buildings: 4 − 1 = 3 directional signs
- __Total: 20 signs__

__Large Commercial Campus (2 entrances, 1,500 ft access, 6 buildings, 2 dead ends):__

- Entrances: 2 × 2 = 4 signs
- Access roads: 1,500 ÷ 75 = 20 signs
- Buildings: 6 − 1 = 5 directional signs
- Dead ends: 2 × 2 = 4 signs
- __Total: 33 signs__

## Sales Conversation Guide

### Discovery Questions

1. "How many entrances will construction traffic use?"
2. "What's the distance from the main entrance to the back of the site?"
3. "Single building or multiple pads?"
4. "Do you have someone handling your fire lane signage, or is that still open?"
5. "Has the fire marshal been out for a pre-construction meeting yet?"

### Positioning Statement

> "One thing we see catch GCs off guard—the fire code requires access road signage before any combustibles hit the site. Since we're already mobilizing for [SWPPP/dust control/temp fence], we can include fire access signs and have them up when we're out there. Based on your site, you'd probably need around [X] signs. Want us to add that to the quote?"

### Objection Responses

__"We'll handle signs ourselves."__
> "No problem—just want to make sure it's on your radar. The fire marshal can hold up work if access isn't signed before combustibles arrive. If it falls through the cracks, give us a call—we can usually get signs out same day."

__"Is that really required?"__
> "Yeah, IFC Chapter 33 requires fire apparatus access to be established and marked before combustible construction. Most inspectors check for it. We've seen jobs get red-tagged for missing signs."

__"How much are we talking?"__
> "[Quote per sign installed, or bundle price]. We're already mobilizing, so there's no extra trip charge if we do it with your [dust control/SWPPP/fence] setup."

## Part 2: Fire Department Access Road Identification Signs (Private Roads & Subdivisions)

This section covers a __different type of sign__ from the fire lane signs above. These are larger wayfinding/identification signs installed at the __entrance__ to private roads and driveways to help emergency responders locate structures that aren't visible from public roads.

- --

### Two Distinct Sign Types: Summary

| Feature | Fire Lane Signs (Part 1) | Access Road Identification Signs (Part 2) |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| __Purpose__ | Parking prohibition/regulatory | Wayfinding/identification for responders |
| __Typical Size__ | 12" × 18" | 24" × 24" to 48" × 48" |
| __Text__ | "NO PARKING – FIRE LANE" | "FIRE DEPT ACCESS ROAD" or address/road name |
| __Placement__ | Every 50-75 ft along fire lane | At ENTRANCE to private road/driveway |
| __Customer__ | GCs on commercial/multi-family construction | Developers, HOAs, rural property owners |
| __Timing__ | During construction (temporary) | Permanent installation at subdivision development |
| __Code Section__ | IFC 503.3 (Marking) | IFC 505.1 (Premises Identification) |

- --

### When Are Large Access Identification Signs Required?

Arizona fire code (IFC 505.1) and local fire district standards require identification signage when:

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| __Building not visible from public road__ | Sign/monument required to identify which driveway serves the address |
| __Private road serving multiple structures__ | Road identification at entrance (especially 3+ homes) |
| __Long driveways (>150–300 ft)__ | Directional signage to guide responders |
| __Gated communities__ | Access identification at gate entrance |
| __Rural subdivisions__ | Road name signs at private road intersections |
| __Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas__ | Enhanced identification requirements |

__Key Code Language (Central Arizona Fire & Medical Authority):__
> "Where the building is not visible from the street or more than one building is on a site, such as a building on a long driveway or private roadway, provision shall be made to clearly identify which driveway or roadway serves the appropriate address at the entrance to the driveway or roadway."

- --

### Sign Specifications (Private Road Identification)

#### Road Entrance Signs

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| __Size__ | Minimum 24" × 24" (many jurisdictions prefer 36"–48" for visibility) |
| __Lettering__ | Minimum 4" high (larger for high-speed roads) |
| __Background__ | Green with white text (standard road sign) OR white with red/black text |
| __Material__ | Reflective aluminum (ADOT-grade or equivalent) |
| __Mounting__ | Post-mounted, 7 ft minimum height to bottom of sign |
| __Visibility__ | Must be legible from moving apparatus on public road |

#### Address Identification Signs

| Jurisdiction | Minimum Height | Additional Requirements |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
| __Arizona State Fire Marshal__ | 4" with ½" stroke | Contrast with background |
| __Phoenix__ | 4" with ½" stroke | Additional locations may be required |
| __Central Arizona Fire & Medical__ | 6" on residential | 12" if structure <50 ft from road; 15" if >50 ft from road |
| __Sun City Fire District__ | 6" minimum | Signs at ≤100 ft intervals along access roads |
| __Copper Canyon Fire & Medical__ | 6" minimum | Provision at entrance to driveway/roadway |

### Arizona Rural Fire Districts (Market Opportunity)

These fire districts serve unincorporated areas where private road identification is most commonly required:

| Fire District | Coverage Area | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| __Daisy Mountain Fire & Medical__ | Anthem, New River, Desert Hills, Black Canyon City, Cave Creek | 250 sq mi in Maricopa/Yavapai Counties |
| __Central Arizona Fire & Medical Authority__ | Prescott, Prescott Valley, Chino Valley area | Detailed standards document available |
| __Arizona Fire & Medical Authority__ | Buckeye Valley, North County, South County | JPA covering multiple districts |
| __Sun City Fire District__ | Sun City, Sun City West area | 100 ft sign spacing requirement |
| __Copper Canyon Fire & Medical District__ | Cave Creek, Carefree area | Standards match CAFMA |
| __Rural Metro Fire__ | Various unincorporated areas | Contract-based coverage |
| __State Fire Marshal__ | Unincorporated areas without local fire code | Default IFC requirements |

__Business Development Note:__ If Desert Services is already doing SWPPP/dust permits for subdivision grading in these areas, large identification signs are needed at the same project phase.

- --

### Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Considerations

WUI areas have enhanced fire access and identification requirements:

| WUI Area | Jurisdiction | Key Requirements |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| __Flagstaff__ | City of Flagstaff | Adopted IWUIC 2008; specific signs & marking requirements |
| __Prescott__ | City/Yavapai County | WUI code with amendments; defensible space requirements |
| __Unincorporated Maricopa (some areas)__ | Rural fire districts | Enhanced access identification in fire-prone areas |

In WUI zones, expect:

- Larger sign requirements for visibility through smoke/night conditions
- More frequent directional signage
- Address signs visible from 150+ ft
- Reflective materials required

- --

### Market Segmentation: Two Different Customers

| Sign Type | Primary Customer | Project Type | Sales Channel |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| __Fire Lane (12×18)__ | General Contractors | Commercial, multi-family, industrial construction | Add to existing SWPPP/dust/fence quotes |
| __Access Road ID (24×48+)__ | Land Developers, HOAs, Rural Property Owners | Rural subdivision development, gated communities, large-lot residential | Subdivision grading phase; HOA referrals |

#### Conversation Starter for Subdivision Work

> "For subdivisions with private roads, the fire district requires identification signs at each road entrance—those larger green/white signs that tell responders which road leads where. Since we're already out here for the grading-phase dust permit, we can install those at the same time. Has the fire marshal specified what they need yet?"
