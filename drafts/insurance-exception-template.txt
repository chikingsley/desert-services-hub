Subject: [Project Name] - Contract Insurance Requirements

Hi [Name],

Reviewing the subcontract for [Project Name] - Attachment C (Insurance Requirements) requires $5M umbrella coverage.

Our current policy:
- GL: $1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate
- Auto: $1M
- Umbrella: $3M
- Workers Comp: Statutory + $500K
- Professional Liability: $2M

We can't sign as-is since we don't carry $5M umbrella. Is it possible to amend Attachment C to $3M umbrella, or issue an exception letter alongside?

Thanks,
