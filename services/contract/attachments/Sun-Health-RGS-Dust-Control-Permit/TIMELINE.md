## Billing Communication Status

### ❌ NOT COMMUNICATED TO BILLING TEAM

**Finding:** The dust permit billing notification was **NOT sent to Kendra or Jason/Jayson**.

**Evidence:**

- Email ID 911, 912, 913: "Dust Permit Ready for Billing: SUN HEALTH"
- Sent TO: `["chi@desertservices.net"]` (Chi sent to himself)
- CC: `[]` (empty)
- Date: December 22, 2025, 12:36:10 UTC

**Comparison:**

- Other dust permit billing notifications from the same day (Dec 22, 2025) WERE sent to:
  - `jayson@desertservices.net`
  - `kendra@desertservices.net`
- Examples: PV Redevelopment Phase 5, Kiwanis Park North - Dog Park Improvements

**Conclusion:** This appears to be an oversight - the billing notification was created but not actually sent to the billing team.
