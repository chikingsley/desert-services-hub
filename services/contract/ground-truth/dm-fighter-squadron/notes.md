Items to document:

- Extended warranties
- Bond premium extensions
- Insurance extensions
- Extended general conditions
- Cost escalation
- Warehouse and CONEX storage rental
- Re-inspections of work already in place
- Reworking of work already put in place, as deemed necessary

## Desert Services Scope

We have been providing SWPPP inspections. CORs (Change Order Requests) submitted through GC Pay.

November 2024: $10,000 change order approved in GCPay to continue services during suspension.

**Change Order Status (RESOLVED):** The $10k COR was created in GCPay to add contract capacity but no work was actually billed against it. A credit memo was applied on 6/5/25 to remove it. Per Kendra (Sept 2025): "It was just a COR sent to get money added to the contract so it was not billing for anything, just needed to get rid of it."

## 2022 vs 2026 Price Comparison

| Item | 2022 Price | 2026 Price | Change |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| SWPPP Narrative | $1,095 | $1,350 | +$255 (+23%) |
| Silt Fence (Install & Remove) | $4.90/LF | $5.50/LF | +$0.60/LF (+12%) |
| Compost Filter Sock (Install) | $2.75/LF | $2.75/LF | $0 (0%) |
| Inlet Protection | $125/EA | $152/EA | +$27/EA (+22%) |
| SWPPP Sign | $275 | $295 | +$20 (+7%) |
| Spill Kit | $325 | $360 | +$35 (+11%) |
| SWPPP Inspections | $295/EA | $205/EA | -$90/EA (-31%) |
| Mobilization | $450 | $265 | -$185 (-41%) |

**Note**: SWPPP inspection unit price and mobilization have actually DECREASED since 2022. The primary cost escalation argument for our services would be:

1. **Extended duration** - More inspections needed due to project timeline extension (originally Sept 2024, now July 2027+)
2. **Insurance costs** - Any additional insurance premiums during suspension period
3. **Re-inspection costs** - Inspections of existing BMPs before resumption

- ASI package will be issued after work resumes for revised building layout pricing
- Failure to respond will result in holding firm to original subcontract requirements
