## Timeline

- 1/5/26: Angela reaches out - NTP starts 1/19/26
- 1/10/26: Jayson requests NOI, dust permit, SWPPP plan
- 1/12/26: Julie sends two NOIs (one per park), dust permit pending
- 1/22/26: Jayson flags - should be two separate estimates/contracts
- 1/27/26: Rick clarifies - intended to treat as one project, ~100 ft apart

---

## Scope Clarification

Originally quoted/contracted as ONE project, but:

- Two NOIs filed
- Two dust permits (pending)
- Two separate locations
- Need TWO SWPPP plans (one per site)

Rick's approach: Treat as one project for inspections since parks are only 100 ft apart. Total budget was $40,000 - came in just under that.

---

## Documents Needed

From Low Mountain:

- [x] Two NOIs (received 1/12/26)
- [ ] Two dust permits
- [ ] SWPPP construction drawings for both parks

---

## Contract/Change Order Situation

Per Rick/Jared (1/27/26): They are issuing either a change order or another contract for the second park.

Need clarification on:

- Is it one contract covering both parks?
- Or separate contracts/POs for each?
- How to handle inspections (one set or two?)

---

## Follow-up Actions

### Clarification Needed (URGENT)

- [ ] Confirm contract structure: one contract for both or separate contracts?

### Monday Cleanup
