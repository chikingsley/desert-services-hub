# Elanto at Prasada — Issues Log

Compliance audit against WORKFLOW.md and extraction standards.

**Last updated:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Most issues RESOLVED after contract extraction

---

## Critical Issues

### ⚠️ COMPANY NAME MISSPELLED (Critical - Fix Before Signing)

**Problem:** Contract p.1 line 4 spells company name wrong:
> "Property Reserve Arizona, LLC ("Owner") and **Deseret** Services LLC ("Contractor")"

But signature block p.6 has it correct:
> "**Desert** Services LLC"

**Why it matters:** Legal documents must have correct party names. "Deseret" vs "Desert" is a different word entirely.

**Fix:** Request Property Reserve correct the contractor name from "Deseret Services LLC" to "Desert Services LLC" in the contract body before signing.

## Resolved Issues

### ✓ CONTRACT PDF OBTAINED

- Downloaded from census DB (email ID 168011, attachment ID 73163)
- Location: `contract-prasada.pdf` (7 pages)
- Also obtained: `eft-authorization-form.pdf`

### ✓ SOURCE CITATIONS ADDED

- All extracted data now has page references
- Example: "Contract Sum: $4,940.00" → contract p.1

### ✓ RECONCILIATION COMPLETED

- Quick quote $3,290 vs Contract $4,940 = +$1,650
- Explanation: Scope extended north, filter sock increased from $3,025 to $4,675
- Math check: RECONCILES

### ✓ NAME CLARIFICATION

- Original confusion: "Jared Aiken" vs "Jared Tieman"
- Resolution: Both are correct people
  - Jared Tieman = Property Reserve contact (external)
  - Jared Aiken = Desert Services signatory (internal)

### ✓ TASKS MERGED INTO NOTES

- Separate tasks.md file deleted
- Content moved to "Follow-up Actions" section in notes.md

### ✓ INSURANCE VERIFIED

- All contract requirements are within our limits
- GL $1M/$2M: Met
- Auto $500K: Met (we have $1M)
- WC Statutory: Met
- Employers $500K: Met (we have $1M)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. SECTION 7 COMPLETION DATES BLANK (Critical - Blocker)

**Problem:** Contract p.2 Section 7 has blank fields:
> "Contractor will complete the Work and have it ready for Owner's inspection by the _____ day of **_**, 20**_"
> "Unless otherwise approved by Owner in writing, Contractor will not commence the Work until after the _____ day of**_**, 20**_"

**Owner:** Jared Aiken needs to determine schedule and fill in dates.

**Fix:** Fill in start and completion dates before signing.

### 2. COI NOT YET REQUESTED

**Problem:** Insurance requirements documented but COI not sent.

**Required:**

- Additional Insured: Property Reserve Arizona, LLC and consultants
- Waiver of Subrogation: Yes
- Primary & Non-Contributory: Yes
- Form: ACORD 25 (2010/05)
- Carrier Rating: B+ Class VII+ (A.M. Best)

**Fix:** Request COI from Dawn.

### 3. W9 2026 NEEDED

**Problem:** Property Reserve needs current year W9.

**Fix:** Prepare 2026 W9.

### 4. MONDAY ESTIMATE NAME MISMATCH (Minor)

**Problem:** Monday estimate #01222609 is named "PRASADA CLUBHOUSE" but work is erosion control.

**Fix:** Update to "ELANTO AT PRASADA - EROSION CONTROL" after contract signed.

## Open Questions

- [x] ~~Is the $4,940 estimate accurate?~~ YES - reconciled, scope extended north
- [ ] Did Property Reserve ever get the mud scraped/swept separately, or is that still needed?
- [x] ~~Confirm erosion control only~~ YES - only filter sock + mobilization in Exhibit A

---

## Ready for Action?

**ALMOST** — Need Section 7 completion dates filled in

**Current status:** Contract extracted with citations, reconciliation complete, insurance verified.

**Single Blocker:**

- Section 7 completion dates are blank - Jared Aiken needs to determine schedule

**Once dates filled:**

1. Get COI from Dawn
2. Prepare W9
3. Sign and return to Sarahi Dehesa

**No red flags** - Standard small project contract with Property Reserve. Utah governing law is normal for them. Our insurance meets all requirements.
