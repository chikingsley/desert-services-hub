## Reconciliation

| | Amount |
|---|--------|
| Original Quick Quote | $3,290.00 |
| Contract Value | $4,940.00 |
| Variance | +$1,650.00 |

**Line Item Reconciliation:**

| KEPT | Mobilization | $265.00 | $265.00 | $0.00 |

**Math Check:** $3,025 + $1,650 = $4,675 (filter sock increased)

## Open Questions

- [x] ~~Is the $4,940 estimate accurate?~~ YES - reconciles (scope extended north, filter sock increased)

- [x] ~~Confirm this is erosion control only~~ YES - only filter sock + mobilization in Exhibit A

---

## Notes

- Owner is Property Reserve Arizona, LLC (Mormon Church real estate arm)
- Contract type: "Owner Contractor Agreement - Minor Project" (their standard small project form)
- Utah governing law and Salt Lake City venue - standard for Property Reserve
- Misspelling in contract header: "Deseret Services" (the Mormon name) vs "Desert Services"
- Project is residential Build to Rent community
- Section 20 work restrictions: No Sunday work, no alcohol/cannabis, no profanity, modest clothing required
- **Separate project alert:** "Elanto at Queen Creek" with Catamount Constructors is a different, larger SWPPP project. Do not confuse.
