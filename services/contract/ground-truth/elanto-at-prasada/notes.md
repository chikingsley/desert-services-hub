## Scope of Work

**Originally requested (1/12/26):**

1. Scrapping mud/dirt off road (too much for street sweeper)
2. Street sweeping after bulk removal
3. Optional: wash roads with 2,000 gal water truck or pressure washing
4. Add wattles or silt fence along farm/paved roads to prevent future erosion

**Quoted scope (1/23/26):**

| # | Description | Qty | Unit | Amount | Source |
|---|-------------|-----|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Wattles/silt fence | ~1,100 | LF | $3,025.00 | quick quote |
| 2 | Mobilization | 1 | EA | $265.00 | quick quote |
| | **Total** | | | **$3,290.00** | |

Note: Final estimate $4,940 in Monday - extended scope to north?

---

## Reconciliation

| | Amount |
|---|--------|
| Quick Quote Total | $3,290.00 |
| Monday Estimate | $4,940.00 |
| Variance | +$1,650.00 |

**Issue:** Price increased from $3,290 to $4,940 - scope extension to north?

**Math Check:** Cannot complete - need to understand what was added for $1,650

## Unit Rates (T&M backup from 1/23/26)

| Item | Rate | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Street Sweeper | $137.00/hr + 10% fuel | |

| Labor | $45.00/hr | |

## Follow-up Actions

### Stage 0: Intake (SLA: 4 hours)

- [ ] **FIND CONTRACT PDF** - Sarahi Dehesa sent 1/27/26, not in census DB
- [ ] Sync census DB to capture recent emails
- [ ] Download contract to folder
- [ ] Find Monday estimate PDF

### Stage 1: Reconciliation (SLA: 1 business day)

- [ ] Extract contract data with page citations
- [ ] Verify insurance against our limits ✓ (should be met)
- [ ] Reconcile $3,290 quick quote vs $4,940 Monday estimate
- [ ] Determine: GOOD TO SIGN or HAS ISSUES

### Before Contract Signing

- [ ] Provide completion dates for Section 7 (Jared Tieman to determine schedule)
- [ ] Prepare 2026 W9 for Property Reserve
- [ ] Complete EFT Authorization form (if opting for electronic payments)
- [ ] Request COI from Dawn with Property Reserve as Additional Insured
- [ ] Sign and return contract to Sarahi Dehesa

### After Contract Signed

- [ ] Create SharePoint folder: Customer Projects/Active/P/Property Reserve/Elanto at Prasada/
- [ ] Upload signed contract

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Is the $4,940 estimate accurate? Quick quote was $3,290, but extended scope to north may have increased it
- [ ] Did Property Reserve ever get the mud scraped/swept separately, or is that still needed?
- [ ] Confirm this is erosion control only (no SWPPP inspection work)
- [ ] Where is the contract PDF from 1/27/26?

---

## Notes

- Small project - direct with owner (Property Reserve), no GC in middle
- Property Reserve is Mormon Church real estate arm
- They have their own contract template ("short form / small project agreement")
- This is erosion control only, not SWPPP
- Time-sensitive - they wanted it done quickly
- Monday estimate name "PRASADA CLUBHOUSE" is incorrect - this is erosion control work

**Separate project alert:** "Elanto at Queen Creek" with Catamount Constructors is a different, larger SWPPP project. Do not confuse.
