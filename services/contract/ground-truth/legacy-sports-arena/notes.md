## What's Needed for Permit

### SWPPP Plan - **NOT RECEIVED**
Rick asked Canyon for it on 12/29/25: "I do not believe that we ever received a SWPPP plan from you. Is that something you can send?"

Chi mentioned on earlier email: "Regarding the SWPPP Plan, we can provide you a quote for one if you don't have one. We will need it to complete the Narrative, Dust Permit and SWPPP Signs."

**Action needed**: Follow up with Brad Davis to get SWPPP plan from them, or quote them for one.

### NOI - **INSTRUCTIONS SENT, STATUS UNKNOWN**
Chi sent NOI instructions (MyDEQ.docx) to Mike at Canyon. Status of actual NOI submission unknown.

**Action needed**: Confirm if NOI was filed with ADEQ.

### Dust Permit - **NOT YET STARTED**
Requires SWPPP plan to complete.

### Drawings - **PARTIAL (ARCH/MEP ONLY)**
OCR'd drawings from `Legacy Sports Arena Drawings - Current - 7.15.2022 Compressed.pdf` (in auto-permit folder).
- 208+ pages of architectural, fire protection, food service equipment sheets
- **NO civil/grading plans** - these are needed for dust permit (acreage, disturbance area)
- See `drawings-ocr.md` for extracted text
- **NOTE**: OCR output is poor quality (hallucinations, garbage text) - unusable for detailed extraction

**Verified**: Monday has the same 7.15.2022 drawing file. Canyon never provided civil plans.
- Chi noted on 01/21: "The construction/civil plans are in Monday but no SWPPP" - but Monday only has arch drawings
- Bid came through BuildingConnected - civil plans may exist there but weren't emailed
- BuildingConnected contact: Brad Davis via Canyon Building & Design

**Action needed**: Request civil/grading drawings from Canyon (Brad Davis) to complete SWPPP narrative and dust permit.
