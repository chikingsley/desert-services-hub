## SCO001 — Unknown Deduct (-$1,665.00)

We do not have the SCO001 document. The -$1,665 deduct brought the contract from $6,330 to $4,665.

Possible explanations:

- Removed inspections (8-9 inspections would be ~$1,560-$1,755)
- Removed combination of items
- The $1,630 dust permit was never in the contract total, so it's not that

**Action needed: Locate SCO001 to confirm what was removed.**
