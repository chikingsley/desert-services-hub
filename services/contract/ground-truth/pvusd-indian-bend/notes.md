## Extraction Notes

**What's important to capture:**
- Project Number (critical for Procore comms)

- Project Location
- Owner (needed for dust permits)
- All contact info (coordinator, PM, super)
- Specific requirements/deadlines
- Billing platform requirements

**Current gap:** We don't currently comply with many of these document/process requirements. Need to improve compliance workflow.

**Philosophy:** Better to extract maximum data upfront - can always trim later. Missing data is harder to recover.

### Key Milestones

| Phase | End Date | Notes |

### Scheduling Notes
