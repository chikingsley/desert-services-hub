## Exhibit A Redlines

Contract asks for things that weren't in the quoted scope. Mark up each one.

11 - Representative at coordination meetings — not quoted, FLAG as scheduling requirement

16 - Dust control:

- 1 dust control sign — included in scope
- "Assume responsibility for fines" — NEVER AGREE, strike (we never accept liability for GC fines)
- Operational dust control — not in scope (can price separately if they want it)

17 - Traffic control — not in scope, strike

19 - Water meter — not in scope, can provide at cost if needed

20 - Construction water — not in scope, can provide at cost if needed

22 - Power wash parking lot — not in scope, can provide at cost if needed

30 - GSA temporary entrance — not in scope, AND can't do in Tucson anyway (no rock), strike

34 - Silt fence or wattle — we quoted compost filter sock, clarify that's what's included

40 - Inspections every 14 days for 9 months — no quantity specified, add "12 inspections included, extras at unit rate"

## Unit Rates (in contract)

Mobilization: $700.00/ea
SWPPP Inspections: $450.00/ea
Stabilized Construction Entrance: $2,625.00
Track-out Grate: $350.00/mo
Concrete Rolloff: $770.00/ea

These look like Tucson rates. Don't know where they came from — verify.

## Rate Discrepancies

Contract unit rates vs our estimate:

Inspections: $450/ea (contract) vs $475/ea (estimate) — $25 less
Mobilizations: $700/ea (contract) vs $475/ea (estimate) — $225 MORE

These are listed as "changes in scope" rates but the discrepancy is notable.
Source of their rates unknown — these look like Tucson rates we didn't quote.

---

## Tucson Pricing Issue

This is a Tucson project. Our estimate used standard (Maricopa) rates.
Contract has different rates — possibly Tucson-specific.

Need internal clarification:

- Do we have Tucson-specific pricing?
- Can't use Maricopa defaults for Tucson projects
- Need explicit Tucson rate card or flag in quoting system

---

## Rules to Add (hook/skill)

- Tucson projects: flag rock entrance requests as OUT OF SCOPE
- "Assume responsibility for fines" language: NEVER AGREE
- Inspection line items without quantity: require redline with specific count
