# Reconcile Contract vs Estimate

Compare contract against estimate to confirm scope, pricing, and billing terms.

---

## Inputs

- Contract data from 01-extract-contract.md
- Estimate PDF (Monday or QuickBooks)

---

## 1. Capture Totals

- Contract total: $________
- Estimate total: $________
- Variance (Estimate - Contract): $________

---

## 2. Compare Line Items

Review each estimate line item and verify it appears in the contract scope.

**Items Removed** (in estimate, NOT in contract):

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| | $ |
| | $ |
| | $ |
| **Total Removed** | $ |

**Items Added** (in contract, NOT in estimate):

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| | $ |
| | $ |
| | $ |
| **Total Added** | $ |

---

## 3. Validate Math

Check: (Estimate - Removed + Added) = Contract total

- Estimate: $________
- Minus Removed: $________
- Plus Added: $________
- **Calculated Total**: $________
- **Contract Total**: $________
- [ ] Match
- [ ] Does NOT match - stop and clarify before proceeding

---

## 4. Decide Outcome

- [ ] **Match** - Totals and scope align. Mark Reconciled.
- [ ] **Revised Estimate** - Contract differs but reconciles. Create new estimate version (do not overwrite original).
- [ ] **Clarification Needed** - Does not reconcile. Draft client questions (see 05-internal-handoff.md).

---

## 5. Red Flags

Check for these issues:

- [ ] Scope items not priced or not clearly defined
- [ ] "If required" or "as needed" without a dollar value
- [ ] Ambiguous quantities or unclear unit pricing
- [ ] Work outside our typical scope
- [ ] Certified payroll required but not disclosed early
- [ ] Missing or mismatched Schedule of Values
- [ ] Unusual retention percent
- [ ] Contract language under IDG (former company)
