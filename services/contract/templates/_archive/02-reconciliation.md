## Purpose

- --

## Inputs

- Contract PDF
- Estimate PDF (Monday or QuickBooks)
- Notion Project record

- --

## Reconciliation Steps

### 1. Capture Totals and Key Terms

- Contract total amount: $________
- Estimate total amount: $________
- Variance (Estimate - Contract): $________
- Retention percent: ________
- Billing platform and window: ________
- Certified payroll required? (Davis-Bacon, HUD, etc): Yes / No
- Schedule of Values present? Yes / No

### 2. Compare Line Items

Review each estimate line item and verify it appears in the contract scope.

- Mark items for removal (in estimate but NOT in contract)
- Add new items (in contract but NOT in estimate)
- As you review: update the QuickBooks estimate to reflect contract changes

Document changes:

- Items removed total: $________
- Items added total: $________
- Net change: $________

### 3. Validate the Math

Verify:

(Estimate - Removed + Added) = Contract total

- If it matches: proceed
- If it does NOT match: stop and draft clarification questions before changing the estimate

### 4. Decide the Outcome

- Match: Totals and scope align. Mark Reconciled.
- Revised Estimate: Contract differs but reconciles. Save a new estimate version (do not overwrite original).
- Clarification Needed: Scope or totals do not reconcile. Draft client questions and set status to Needs Clarification.

### 5. Review Red Flags (All Projects)

- Scope items not priced or not clearly defined
- "If required" or "as needed" without a dollar value
- Ambiguous quantities or unclear unit pricing
- Work outside our typical scope
- Certified payroll required but not disclosed early (Davis-Bacon)
- Missing or mismatched Schedule of Values
- Retention percent unusual for the project
- Contract language under IDG (former company)
